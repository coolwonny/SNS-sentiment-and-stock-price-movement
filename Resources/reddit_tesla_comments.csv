ExtruDRÿteslamotorsÿ2020-10-14 23:58:40ÿI still can’t get over how “plain” these Teslas are.    I mean, I appreciate them as cutting edge engineering and sincerely believe that electric cars are and should be what we will (all) be driving in the future.  I can’t wait to get one, when I can actually afford one (an electric car, I mean).  Having said this, the Tesla design language is like “anti-design” it’s like they intentionally set out to create the most featureless range of cars possible.  Even the interiors are sort of unnecessarily “plain.”ÿg8uliuy

It's still not clear even among the major players who will win - Google, Tesla, other automakers, Uber/Lyft, a newcomer, etc. But beyond the auto industry there's going to be changes to infrastructure, regulations, insurance, travel, advertising, health insurance, gas stations/parking garages, finance. A system of truly autonomous vehicles that consumers don't have to own or drive in any capacity at all is a very different world.ÿg8ul86b

I’m in a similar situation (albeit smaller budget) and figured I’d use the opportunity to start owning random cars that wouldn’t be practical to commute in (due to age, reliability, or safety), but I thought might be a novelty to drive for a few months.   Once it’s back to needing a practical safe commuter a Tesla would be perfect, but in the meantime I feel like I just want to buy a Miata, maybe a random classic British sports car or some other nonsensical crap that would quickly lose it’s charm if I had to commute in it.

im_thatoneguyÿteslamotorsÿ2020-10-14 23:53:13ÿ"&gt;Visual only can perceive depth just fine using two optical sensors. Every person with working eyes gets their depth perception purely visually everyday just fine, and programming for that depth perception isn't difficult.  You can close one eye and get very good depth perception.  Or even play racing games on a 2D screen well enough to race.  The human brain is pretty impressive without stereo vision.  Especially at the distances most driving takes place where our stereo vision is nearly useless.  A vast amount of our brain is dedicated to the visual cortex.  So saying ""Humans do fine with two optical sensors"" is ignoring the elephant in the room: human level intelligence and human level spatial understanding.  &gt;by forgoing that spatial crutch, Tesla is forcing itself to devise a significantly better end product.  So far Tesla has just been slowly rebuilding Lidar+HD Maps in a neural network. Karpathy in OP's video talks about how most of their planning and driving code is still traditional C++ code.  You're saying that Tesla was forced to use AI to do something that everybody else hard coded... but Tesla also is still using traditional code exactly the same.  The difference is that Tesla has spent most of their time and money reproducing LIDAR+Maps which Waymo and Cruise have had all along.   This rewrite only puts Tesla back to where everybody else started and for route planning, they're currently using the exact same approach. Karpathy says that approach is good because it's deterministic and predictable.  Referring to using AI in order to interact with objects spatially over time he refers to as ""indirect"" and has a cost.  Up until now, Tesla has been woefully behind on Autopilot vs every other LIDAR competitor because they didn't have depth perception or HD maps (within the domains where the competitors had maps).  We aren't going to see any benefit to Tesla's approach until next year at the earliest when they start doing the things you claim Tesla has been doing all along.  They aren't going to *start* using AI widely in place of hand tuned classic code until Dojo comes on line.  And only then will they start to realize the advantage of having achieved what everybody else started with but without lidar since then they have the equivalent of a million lidar collecting vehicles instead of 20,000.  Tesla is playing the long game which may or may not pay off in a year or two.  But they're in a tight race with the cost of LIDAR.  For FSD's $8k you can outfit a car with LIDAR better than the output of what Tesla has achieved with a neural network.  Tesla might have pulled another Rain Sensor where eventually they achieve parity... kind of... with a dedicated sensor but it took so long that it was the woefully choice in retrospect.  Tesla spending 2 years on psuedolidar and birdseye awareness might pay off some day, or they may have been able to save a ton of money by just spending $8k on LIDAR instead of $8k worth of R&amp;D..."ÿg8ukyuw

They also said that they want to have 42,000 satellites in the constellation, that's over 700 launches, not counting launches to replace the satellites that get de-comissioned... That's about 7 times more launches than what they have done in their history, total.  I agree with you that they're in a much better position to achieve this than the others that came before.

If you were making double the standard wage (or even more as a coder in the US) you could probably afford your own Tesla and would never consider the bus, or you might decide you want a nice car to drive you to work every day. And your quality of life would go up much more in other ways with the added money. All in all if you've got a roof over your head and are somewhat happy in life it doesn't matter though. Hell if you have a good attitude your life is better than most anywhere in the world.ÿg8ukmgr

tslamoneyÿthetagangÿ2020-10-14 23:35:36ÿI might be in a similar situation with my TSLA $470 covered call that is likely to get ITM tomorrow or Friday. My plan is take a loss with that CC. And I want to minimise that loss. The plan is to let time decay erase time value on that contract as much as possible and when/if it gets closer to be ITM, close my position. The risk here is IV that might jump as the contract gets closer to be ITM - and increase my loss. I’ll take that risk.  I am not considering rolling the contract, as I want to sell new CC next week.  Let’s see how this will play out.ÿg8uj4j4

dgg3565ÿSpaceXLoungeÿ2020-10-14 23:32:52ÿ"&gt;Agreed.  Tesla has a much higher chance of getting buried by a market leader like GM.  I've spent some time watching both Tesla and SpaceX. Long story short, depending on which technologies you're talking about (batteries, motors, electronics, etc.), Tesla is about five to ten years ahead of everyone else, and they do things that no one else is doing, such as ""megacasting"" the entire car frame, reducing it from one hundred and seventy components down to two (and eventually one). GM might be a market leader in internal combustion (more by institutional inertia than anything else), but they aren't a market leader in EVs, which is a different beast altogether. In EVs, everyone is eating Tesla's dust.  &amp;#x200B;  But the most important fact is that Tesla is not an automotive company, they're a technology company that happens to make electric cars. Software, along with domestic-level and grid-scale energy solutions, are increasingly important parts of their product line. Simply looking at the automotive side, though, what they've done is created a new market in which they're the best at what they do. And they've successfully laid the foundations to dominate that market—and EVs look like they'll replace ICE as **the** automotive market—into the foreseeable future.  &amp;#x200B;  Right now, SpaceX is roughly where Tesla was from 2017 to 2018, scaling up mass production in the process of creating a fundamentally new market. Starlink is one part of the plan, but don't focus too heavily on that one part. The market that they're creating, a market in which ULA and Boeing are not even competing, is rockets-as-airliners, to carry cargo or passengers to wherever you please."ÿg8uiuf2
junesixÿteslamotorsÿ2020-10-14 23:32:38ÿThe difference is Best Buy is a reseller. They didn’t manufacture your iPhone. They can offer you 14 day price guarantee on phones because they have policies in place with the manufacturer (Apple). So they can offer you a 14 day return policy on iPhone which translates into a 14 day price guarantee. https://www.bestbuy.com/site/help-topics/return-exchange-policy/pcmcat260800050014.c?id=pcmcat260800050014&amp;CMP=ocss  Go look at Apple. Their own return policy is 14 days so their price guarantee on iPhone is 14 days https://www.apple.com/shop/help/returns_refund. If you bought an iPhone, 15 days ago - too bad.   Tesla: 7 day return policy. So their price guarantee is 7 days. https://www.tesla.com/support/tesla-return-policy  Manufacturer price guarantees have nothing to do with “good will”. It’s explicitly a function of their return policy and wanting to avoid returns solely for purpose of getting the new price.ÿg8uitku

FLAlex111ÿRealTeslaÿ2020-10-14 23:29:38ÿTLDR;  &gt;*MSCHF*, an internet group that has made a name for its cynical viral campaigns and products, has launched an effort aimed at taking down companies it deems evil. Among these companies are Tesla, *Amazon*, *Facebook*, *Palantir* and, interestingly enough, TikTok itself, to name a few.   &gt;   &gt;Participants in the campaign are required to post a “takedown” video of one of the target companies, MSCHF is offering rewards for these Tesla videos, offering $1,000 for every video that attacks the electric car maker, provided they hit 500,000 views or more.   &gt;   &gt;The custom sound created for Tesla takedown videos featured Elon Musk’s name in the popular song “Bad Guy” by Billie Eilish. ÿg8uiifu
PrintfRedditÿOculusQuestÿ2020-10-14 23:29:20ÿSure, what would you like to know? I'm using $300 trial credit from Google which they hand out like candy, AWS does the same but AWS has Tesla T4 which is slightly weaker. I've requested a V100 from them but that's gonna take time I think. The machine I'm using would probably end up costing AUD 2.5-3.0 per hour and it is definitely not worth it if you game regularly, but I'm using the trial credit to survive until I can get a GPU.   It's a N1 machine with 8 vCPU and 30GB RAM with Tesla P100 (V100 isn't available in Sydney with GCP) on Windows. I've used Parsec in the past so I was familiar with the process, but it doesn't take more than 30-45 minutes for the whole setup.ÿg8uihc6

PowerMechGuyÿSamsungDexÿ2020-10-14 23:27:01ÿOh boy...  My Most Used Apps PART 1:  Music:  1. FL Mobile: I use this to make music.  2. Caustic Mastering: I use this to master said music.  3. Audio Evolution: I use this to finalize and make any cuts to said mastered music.  4. Avee Music Player: I use this to visualize videos of said finalized music.  Photography:  1. Manual Camera: It allows me to take epic videos with my phone and great pictures with my tablets.  2. PicsKit: This app allows me to edit pictures and use layers!  3. Photostudio: This app makes quick edits like resizing and cropping super easy.  4. Toolwiz: It's a new editor I found for making collages. But there is alot more here I haven't explored.  Video Editing:  1. Vivacut: This is my video editor of choice.  2. Filmmaker: The way this app deals with stickers allows me to make sectional animations for my videos.  3. Androvid: This app is full of tools that help me with managing video files.  3D Stuff:  1. AutoQ3d: This app is no longer on the play store. It's a very powerful cad design program.  2. ScorchCad: This is the android clone of OpenSCAD. I absolutely love how easy and powerful this app is. It makes rapid prototyping very fun.  3. Cad Assistant: This app is totally free but super powerful. It allows me to view basically any 3D object I create. It also allows me to take measurements in 3D space!  4. SubDivFormer: I like this app because it's so simple. I use it to practice making shapes in 3D. Everything starts with a cube.  5. Graphite: This is another 3D object viewer. I love how simple the interface is.  3D printing:  1. Gcode Printr: This app allows me to print directly to my Wanhao Powerspec Duplicator I3 Plus! This enables me to streamline the prototyping process and print things way faster. Plus, because I can print from my tablets, I can load the gcodes right from my ftp backup system!  2. 3D Fox: This app allows me to print to my tronxy. The interface is very clean.  Digital Art:  1. Infinite Painter: I absolutely love this app. It is simply a joy to use. The interface is minimal. The tools are excellent. And the S-pen support is top notch.  2. Artflow: I like to do random sketches in this app. It's interface is even more minmal.  3. TouchDraw: This is a very powerful vector graphics app. I've made a desktop background, discord server icon, album covers, and various app assets all with this app.  4. Flipaclip: This app makes animation easy and fun. I have yet to make anything serious. But now that I have this new device, that might change.  5. Rough Animator: This app looks alot like an older version of flash. It's interface is rough, but the feature set is solid and reliable. Also, it deals with layers very well.  Electronics:  (I havn't used some of these apps in a while, but I'm planning to get back into it soon)  1. ArduinoDroid: This app allows me to program arduinos from any android devices over usb otg. With this app, I programmed my first robot from an android tv; very good times...  2. Droid Tesla Pro: I used this app a long time ago when I was learning how to read circuit diagrams. I plan to build more advanced circuits, but so far all I've made is a nand flip-flop. it is a little cryptic buy very powerful.  3. EveryCircuit: This app makes learning electronics fun. You can use it to get a great grasp of the basics very quickly and easily.  4. Electrodoc Pro: This is a reference app for electronics. I use it for reminding me of how to read resistors and for doing basic calculations with ohm's law.  Automation:  1. Automagic: By far the most advanced automation app I've ever used. Using it in conjunction with GMD gestures and Max Remote Full, I was able to construct a custom macro pad for Elite Dangerous. It worked very very well.  2. Automate: this was the very first automation app I bought. It's very powerful, I just forget to use it with Automagic laying around.  3. MacroDroid: This app makes automation super simple. I use it when I need something basic but essential to happen in the background.  Programming:  1. Programming Hub: This app is so useful! It has cheat sheets for nearly every common language of today. It comes with courses that are constantly being updated. I highly recommend this one if you are an avid coder of many languages.  2. Sand IDE: The reason this one is so high is because my first language was java. The interface is very simple and for basic programming, this app is excellent. However, I'm not so sure it's on the play store any more.  3. Pydroid 3: This app is awesome. Not only can you code in python, but you can also download other libararies and features. It is fully featured and the editor is customizable and clean.  4. AIDE: This app is rediculously powerful. I'm using it to learn how to make apps on android. But this app is so powerful that you can download source code off of github and build/compile apps right on your device. It's so awesome.  5. CppDroid: I haven't used this app much, but I intend too once I get back to C. I like it because it was made by the same developers who made arduinodroid. With this app you can see a breakdown of your code while you make it. Classes, methods, and variables will appear in an outline on the side allowing you to keep coding without getting lost.  6. WebMaster: This app is fun to use. It's a website creation tool. It recognizes HTML, CSS, and Javascript. (it might actually recognize some other stuff too.) I use this app to practice making websites and to get more familiar with website related programming.  7. Java N Ide: This app has a really nice interface and is also has a breakdown of the files and parts of your code. It's one of my upgrades for Sand. 8. Fasthub: This app is a portal for github. It's interface makes browsing through projects simple and easy.  Linux:  1. Andronix: This app makes installing stuff into termux super easy. The modded distros are excellent. Although some of them are having some repository trouble.  2. Termux: I'm sure mostly everyone knows about this app. I've done some pretty nifty stuff with this app. Termux is what allows me to run Slic3r in a linux distro in a chroot environment. Because of this, I no longer need a computer in order to slice my 3D objects and can prototype entirely on my android device.  3. Bvnc: This vnc app has an excellent interface and makes working with vnc connections easy and fast.  Astronomy:  1. StarWalk 2: This app has some of the best images of deep space objects all in one place. It has a nice feature set and is very beautiful.  2. Redshift: This app allows you to use your mouse and keyboard to navigate and can therefore be used in dex without the touchpad. It's database is very extensive and it's ability to take to you to the perspective of deep space objects is truly powerful.  3. Sky Safari 6: This is a new app in my collection. It's feature set is vast. I'm not sure what it's limits are as of yet.  4. Orrery: This app is lovely. It shows the positions of the planets in the solar system. The music makes it so that you don't want to leave.  5. Solar Walk 2: This app's perspective of the cosmos is something to behold. I just like the way you can zoom out and become a traveller among the stars.  Monitoring:  1. Castro: This app's layout makes finding basic information like remaining storage and/or battery life very easy. It's very customizable and modern.  2. Aida 64: I like the way this app gives you all the information in a very clean and simple format. Great for getting cpu temps and speeds.  3. 3C Pro Tools: This app is so powerful I could write about it all day. But my favorite part about it is it's widgets that give you all kinds of stats. You can choose almost anything and have it sit on your home screen so you can get an idea of what your usage is looking like. You can monitor almost anything in their widgets.  App Backups:  1. Buggy Backup: This app is by far the most powerful app backup solution I have ever used. I like the way it handles backing up newly installed apps in the background.  2. App2SDPro: This app is for rooted devices. When it works right, It can allow you to move the entire filesystem of an app to a special partition on your sd card. Very epic stuff.  Notetaking:  1. Notes: I know there are alot of apps called notes. The one I'm talking about has a yellow and brown icon. It makes taking notes super easy. But the best part is the way it backs up the database. It also has a search feature which makes navigating my 200+ notes super fast.  2. Handwrite Pro: This app is a vector based note taking solution. It makes taking notes customizeable and fun. Plus, you can have infinitely large pages! And it backs up to Google Drive. (I've tested it and it works.)  3. Nebo: I like the potential this app has. The ability to make diagrams and input math equation is super cool.  4. Write: This is a super simple S-pen focused writing application. I love it because it tries it's best not to get in your way while being loaded with features.  5. Samsung Notes: just freakin awesome all around.  TO BE CONTINUED...ÿg8ui8fc

KrombopulosThe2ndÿpoliticsÿ2020-10-14 23:22:49ÿ"The issue I always see is reddit just wanting to tax people who make more than them rather than taxing the people who actually deserve to be taxed at a much higher rate due to their hoarding of wealth.. Generally if someone makes 50k/year then they want to tax the people making 100k. If they make 100k/year then they want to tax the people making 200k. Its always a sort of vengeance for 'whoever makes more than I do' then levels of taxation that actually make sense and punish the people who are making the world worse off with their wealth.   The total revenue difference to the US government between taxing people making (A) 250k+/year or (B) 400k+/year is pretty much negligible because there are so few people in that range compared to the VAST outliers making tens of millions and billions of dollars (and using dumb loopholes and Capitol gains to pay almost nothing in taxes) . The only thing it solves is make people with &lt;250k salaries feel better.   &gt;The typical area household earns $117,474 a year  Yes because you are looking at a ""metro area"" for every greeter at the Walmart, worker at the goodwill store, and sandwich maker at the panera making 35k there is a random software analyst working at Google or AirBnB or engineer at tesla making ~200k averaging it out. Those software analysts and engineers are not the issue in the world, they are not lobbying the government, they are not funding million dollar advertising sprees and buying media platforms. Most of them are Democrats probably who are smart or just got lucky in life vs the people who inherited millions from their daddies and never want to pay taxes on those millions."ÿg8uhsb7

Steelplate7ÿAskALiberalÿ2020-10-14 23:21:29ÿI am saying that if the ACA stays as is, and a Public Option is added... that will force private insurance companies (and the providers) to compete with that public option. This will bring costs down for everyone(private or public consumers).  I mean, c’mon... look outside of our country. We pay 32% more than the next most expensive country in the world and damn near 50% more than the world median....yet we have LESS access to healthcare than most of the modern world.  For profit healthcare/insurance is a terrible model. As people age, their healthcare needs rise...eventually giving way to losing money...so...in a for profit system...the worst thing you can do (from a profit/loss perspective) is to give people quality healthcare...because they are going to outlive the profit margin.  The BEST thing we could do is socialize healthcare and have the younger healthy people help pay for the elderly, weak and sick and doctors, nurses, other personnel and other operating costs are paid.  When insurance companies take a cut, when hospitals and doctors’ offices take a cut, when labs take a cut? That means less access to the consumer along with more cost. It’s a sucker’s bet.  Furthermore....big pharma spends more on television advertising than the do on R&amp;D...so don’t tell me that innovation will suffer. Let doctors be doctors.... don’t tell ignorant, uneducated people to “ask their doctor about Humira” just to boost sales and rattle off a mile long laundry list of potential side effects by some speed speaking clown. Let the doctors do what they went to school for.  And Med/Tech? Don’t even get me started...the MAXIMUM an MRI Machine costs is $3M for a top of the line ultra efficient 3 Tesla. It isn’t about the cost and maintenance of those machines...it is the provider gouging the customer....period.  Having a very large group bound together gives them the power to stop the bullshit.ÿg8uhn9d

FrikchaÿFellowKidsÿ2020-10-14 23:16:44ÿappreciate you being the kind of person to dump 70,000 words on a person and ask them to fact check but despite the fact that many of these are actually fairly fact-light opinion pieces or have nothing to do with the emotional sensibilities of the man; I can still say pretty certainly that business insider Australia has been involved in curating a lot of shady and untrue aspects of stories for a click or two (I live in Australia and see it on my feed quite alot).  The headlines of that article are inaccurate, it uses dumb logic to attempt to convince you that the serious injury rates in the workplace have gone up or are shockingly bad, when they're admittedly but only slightly below average. Its not even talking about current Tesla its talking about Tesla from 6 years ago and the injury statistics from back then. They then accuse the company of lying about its improved safety standard over the years only using its statistics from 6 years ago as reference to  justify this, not only that but layering identical but slightly differently calculated stats over the top of each other to make it sound/look like a lot of bad things when realistically they are just different grading systems for the same thing.  There's an entire paragraph of the article sourced from vague tweets finally capping off as someone expresses fear for the Tesla workers who haver a higher chance of accident due to ramping up production. That is one of the few moderately true things used fairly for evidence to support the piece; that making more cars will indeed in some way raise the chances/presentation of chance for injury in the factory by some small amount at least.  So yeah its not even a matter of direct easy-to-discard lies in this one, its the kind of wording that really speaks to people who already have a certain mindset/opinion and the continuous usage of unnecessary info only helps that shady method of getting their news across.ÿg8uh5b6

heydude1473ÿcarsÿ2020-10-14 23:15:37ÿCorrect, though the Tesla 250kw network isn't that big (yet).  Between charging infrastructure and better efficiency/range (I think Bjorn did a back to back test and was 20-30% more efficient in the 3) the Model 3 is going to be a far better car for covering long distances. Now if you can charge at home and only plan on driving to work and around town, that advantage diminishes and it'll come down much more to personal preference.ÿg8uh18v

yes_im_listeningÿTeslaModel3ÿ2020-10-14 23:10:38ÿDepends on how fast you need to charge.  As others said, the car will come with a J1772 adapter. That’s probably the most common connector you’ll find for “level 2” (normal speed) charging (like 5-8hrs from 20% or so).  For fast charging (level 3) you need a Tesla supercharger and that takes 30-40 minutes from 20% or so.  There is a Chademo adapter which is about $500 USD. I think that’s still considered “level 3” but it’s a lot slower than a typical Tesla supercharger. I’ve never used it so no idea how long it takes, but for perspective, I think it’s something like: Level 2: ~8kW Chademo: ~50kW Tesla supercharger: 72-250kW (depending on the location)  So Chademo is 6x faster that level 2 but still a bit slower than a supercharger.ÿg8ugiiz

MantuaMattersÿblursedimagesÿ2020-10-14 23:09:26ÿYeah if you’re grounded or you are in series with the flow your body can absorb and let a lot of current flow through you. Extreme High voltage line workers get dropped off by helicopter on to lines that hold over 200k volts. There is no ground in the air. So they let the electricity flow through them as they work. Tesla used to show this feat off as a side show with his Tesla coils which helped pay for his research in the early days of electricity.  Edit: actually at that voltage your body becomes more of a resistor than anything elseÿg8uge04

blitheringblueeyesÿTeslaModel3ÿ2020-10-14 23:08:54ÿChademo and CCS are different DC fast charging connectors, the Tesla chademo adaptor allows charging at up to 50 KW DC, which would take maybe 90-100 minutes to fully charge a M3 battery. The Tesla Supercharger can go up to 250 KW depending on what generation it is. That’ll fully charge the battery in about 50 minutes.  J1772 is AC charging, the M3 can pull up to 8 KW off that, but it depends on the voltage and current that the charging station can supply. It would take about 10 hours to fully charge a M3 battery, more if the voltage or amperage on the charging station is lower. Chargepoint is the largest network of AC chargers, they usually supply 6-7 KW so it’d be more like 12 hours for a full charge. AC charging rate is around 20-24 miles of range per hour.  Pretty much all AC charging stations are J1772. Tesla also includes a portable charger and some plug adaptors with the car, so you can charge from a wall plug, but at a really low rate, like 2 miles per hour of charging. If you have access to a 240V dryer plug, it’ll charge at closer to 15-20 mile per hour of charging.ÿg8ugbxx

sn4p9yÿwhatcarshouldIbuyÿ2020-10-14 23:06:05ÿThe only two downsides of the Tesla are the lack of engine control and some spotty quality control. Otherwise it has great performance, is better for being a daily, and is cheaper to maintain by a lot with yearly maintenance being a few hundred less than both other options. The mental block from not hearing big revs when you punch the gas is a big one to get over so if you can’t get over it the C8 is probably the way to go with it being more of a sports car with the M4 being more of a GT car.ÿg8ug19j

YoureInGoodHandsÿRentersÿ2020-10-14 22:58:00ÿ"Couple things:  Imagine if next year your local city council passed a law that said options traders could only make 4% more than they did last year.  I mean, busdrivers could make whatever the market could bear, so could waiters and programmers and really, absolutely everyone else.  But your specific profession could never, ever get a raise of more than 4%, regardless of special circumstance.  How pissed would you be?  That's how pissed I was.  &gt; I guess as an options trader I understand that you’re not always going to win and you have to take some of the gains of your win and use them to prepare for a loss at times.  100% true.  When you sell a stock (or whatever option traders do, sorry, all my money is sunk into landlording), you do it for a reason.  Maybe over years it goes up 10% YOY and gains a ton of value.  Maybe it took a 5% loss this spring and you sat on it for a while and then it lost 2% this summer and you were like let's hold on for fall, then they release quarterly earnings and it drops 0.25% today and you're like, fuck it, sell it.  Isn't it kinda stupid to sell on the news of a 0.25% loss?  I mean, yes, if that were the only factor, that's extraordinarily stupid.  So I look at your stock sale and I'm like ""what an idiot"".  But you, the options trader, have a decade worth of history with the stock, and it's really a much deeper decision than what happened today.  The landlord might have his wife pressuring him to move to Florida.  Maybe he wants to liquidate to dump it all in Tesla stock.  Maybe he made 250% in 5 years in RE and he woke up this morning and saw the polls and was like ""fuck it, Biden's in, I'm out"".  It might still be stupid, but there are other factors at play."ÿg8uf6jk

cheddarbenÿstocksÿ2020-10-14 22:56:58ÿI guess I am not understanding what isn't adding up. The peak shares were 26 billion for apple, which was never directly included in any of the calculations I made, just a comparison. The p/s as of 12/31 of 2019 was 4.99. I used the 4.99 number in the calculations and mentioned AMZN number to illustrate what a mature 'growth' (if you would consider them growth) company might look like.  TSLA owners like to talk about the future, as though no numbers can be placed on it and we can just rest assured that prices will go up, up, up! While we can't know what a yearly report looks like in 5 or 10 years, we can make thoughtful looks at the future based on the current market, the company guidance, and similar (if not vertical, in spirit) companies.   People love to talk about TSLA like it is the next AMZN or APPL, but they aren't talking about what the balance sheet looks like, they are glossy eyed about the pps and how much it has grown. Yet, for both AMZN and APPL, the pps wouldn't be where it is without some effin stellar balance sheets over several years, not to mention a super friendly market and economy. People aren't particularly interested in digging into the actual old balance sheets or comparing what the price was back when they were actual risks and people didn't see them as the bohemeths they became.   I am waiting for someone to share a hypothetical balance sheet that might happen in five or ten years and then talk about what possible prices might be.  And to be clear, I *like* TSLA. I would love one of the cars and it might be in my future. I just don't think the pps is real.ÿg8uf2l2

panick21ÿelectricvehiclesÿ2020-10-14 22:48:28ÿThe Model Y is right in what the Europeans already buy increasingly. I don't really know if I would call it a 'coupe' anyway and the format of the car doesn't really matter that much. Its a big crossover thingy.  The Model Y has mostly good press, but the reality is that they never need much press and they sell them easily.   Model Y in Germany will be the first with all the new Tesla technology including battery, structure and pain, and it will not have to pay import and transportation cost anymore.  If demand is really an issue they could make it cheaper, as they have huge margin when it is scaled.ÿg8ue5pv

SippieCupÿteslamotorsÿ2020-10-14 22:47:21ÿ"&gt; That's what I think FSD will be doing and why this next rewrite is essential. Labeling, in order to provide rich metadata for searches of low confidence situations / disengagements. If 99.9% of driving is disengagement free then Tesla has widdled down 10 billion miles to a manageable 10 million miles of interesting data.  Its literally impossible to do that on a 4g cellular network connection and a computer that only has 16GB of free storage. Furthermore, even if you could upload 7 1080p streams through a 4G connection, AT&amp;T's networks would fail. Futhermore, even if AT&amp;Ts network didnt fail, it would be so monstorously expensive that it would be cheaper to just hire people to drive around where you can ensure they are driving well.  Furthermore, 10 million miles of interesting data, is 30% of what Google used and failed.  &gt; How do you ""generalize"" metadata for new situations when you're just solving edge cases by adding more metadata flags for missing metadata? Even if it's unsupervised labeling it's still attempting to address an infinite number of edge cases using a finite number of labels.  I mean.. my company is able to flag these kind of attributes through completely unsupervised methods. `Cabinets.Wooden.Painted.Blue` is how the model recognizes the cabinets in that picture.  If I was able to build it, I'm sure Tesla AP Engineers can. You need to have some search space to be able to get any outputs at all. This is how they are doing it straight from the person building the unsupervised FSD system you are trying to tout.  Are you suggesting just giving it driving data, with absolutely no guidance in validation, that it will just spawn outputs somehow, and those outputs will map to the steering angle and vEgo of the car? Thats literally impossible.  At the very least you have to specify what your outputs are. Sure, you can quantify the amount of outputs, and then only what those outputs should be - A number, a string, etc. But do you think that throwing a bunch of driving data is going to make that number be the steering angle? No. Its going to be some number that correlates to noise. You need to have a path to convergence.  &gt;I don't think anyone knows if it'll work. It might fail miserably and be a total waste.   Dojo won't be a total waste, your proposed idea of what it is would be. Which is why that is not what they are doing.   Lastly, this..  &gt;AutoML is obviously extremely compute intensive since you're both searching the weight space but also the architecture space.   AutoML is NOT unsupervised training. Its not even model training in the traditional sense. It is a way of modulating and tuning parameters of a model being trained to see if you can get better results. Its for finding the optimal architecture for a task, not creating a model for the task in the first place.   Ask yourself this, If labeled data is so far in the wrong direction, then why is Karpathy, the guy BUILDING DOJO, is still harping on the fact label quality is the most important thing in ML?"ÿg8ue1bs

I bought the 620 for 710 at close and sold at 10 for a %15 gain at 820. It hit a high of 1015 around 3:30. That’s a 40% gain in under 24 hrs with the underlying only moving 4%.

paulwesterbergÿelectricvehiclesÿ2020-10-14 22:23:38ÿ"This week Tesla had already reduced the Model S price by 3k, down to a base of $71,990. Which is already $69,420 in the online configurator with ""estimated savings"" included.   I think Elon just wanted to make some headlines and sell more cars this quarter. Announcing a price drop to that magic number is sure to get a lot more attention than spending $2.5k per vehicle on marketing."ÿg8ubdp7
HakawathaÿPhysicsÿ2020-10-14 22:23:37ÿAbsolutely stoked about the 9 Tesla limits to the start of magnetic degradation. That's huge; Earth field is 60 microtesla, and most scientific vector mags are more than nanotesla precise. This can carry serious current.ÿg8ubdlk
BlakeLockedÿteslainvestorsclubÿ2020-10-14 22:23:36ÿSo I'm going to preface this by saying outright that I'm a nervous person, and someone who tries to be cautious with investments.  I think that, pending some major news bulletin making the whole market panic and drop out, the share price will keep rising into earnings. I'd be shocked if Tesla reported a loss this quarter, but I'd still expect some degree of a short-term dip or drop in the day or two after ER, just as people sell the news and such. If I were holding shorter-term options (and I am), I'd sell naked calls (maybe covered calls as well if you want to take the risk) on Wednesday and re-buy on Thursday or Friday.  After earnings... That's the big question. Last week of October SHOULD be more growth in share price, doubly so as analysts process whatever guidance or earnings call info comes. But the election, regardless of the fact that both outcomes favor Tesla, is going to make the markets weird and touchy.  I'm going to get downvoted and dogpiled for saying this, but I would seriously consider taking profits if you're in TSLA for the shorter term by the end of the month (though every situation is different - I can enter and exit whenever because I'm working in non-taxable accounts, but others might need to factor short-term capital gains, etc). If you're holding for a decade and don't care that much, you'll be fine and probably have a cost basis that makes fear pointless by now. But if you're more sensitive to short term movements... a lot is going to be up in the air, the market as a whole is euphoric and inflated, and I personally wouldn't risk it for the potential $20ish in upside if everything goes peachy perfect.  I don't think there'll be a big crash unless the election is contested for a few weeks and stimulus is held up until it's resolved, or unless the election takes a few days to call with certainty AND states start locking down again. But I think there's a week or two of downturn coming that's going to hurt some people's portfolios, that could be better played as a discount after jumping out at a satisfying high.ÿg8ubdka
captainXcannabisÿDaytradingÿ2020-10-14 22:23:35ÿDo some backtesting, how often does TSLA have a huge drop that doesnt recover before the monthly expiration, what caused those drops and do you think there will be another anytime soon? Personally i believe that TSLA is wayyy over extended and is in need of a solid correction, so i wouldnt be taking long biased positions. But then again i was saying that back when it was $800 pre-split, so wtf do i know lol.ÿg8ubdih

Pickle-Chanÿriskofrainÿ2020-10-14 22:19:56ÿThis is genuinely why I think dios is a very bad item. Sure, you get value out of it, and there are some tiny niches where you may want it. But over 99% of the time, literally any other red would be doing you more good. If you couldn't get dios because it was literally removed from the game, maybe you get a tesla coil or dagger and they help you win this fight. Maybe you get a desk plant and kill small mobs to have absurd healing zones everywhere and it lets you kite them out. Maybe you hit frost relic, and the extra damage on nearby jellyfish and teleporting parents lets you focus on dodging. Heck relic could even proc a uke or something and put in a lot of extra damage, and its considered one of the worse reds.    All of these offer advantages not only in this fight, but before it too. More damage or survivability may make looting or other boss fights faster, resulting in a lower difficulty and more items at the time you would get this fight. Changes in tempo especially from reds in this game are really important, and when you'd likely have significantly higher chances of survival from a red whip 2 stages ago over a dios doing nothing, I think its safe to conclude the item needs a rework.   I genuinely believe that if dios was removed from the game, player consistency would go up. The only thing dios is good for is farming sacrifice void fields twice as hard, and killing you in non sac runs when you aren't prepared for it and enemies get it.ÿg8uayqd

Sorry to say but the Model 3 is a league above this. No ID3 gets most often compared to the E Niro or Kona. Both have more range, offer more features at a lower price. ID3 has better driving dynamics and more room than the Kona but not the E Niro. That's about it. The first edition owners in German forums don't find the airbag thing funny. Do you?ÿg8uav03

4333mhzÿinvestingÿ2020-10-14 22:18:36ÿThis sub is extremely conservative in general, so you will rarely hear anything good about speculative stocks that go parabolic. Honestly the opinions are a good foil to wsb, since you can get both ideas. Anyhow, Tesla is an interesting case. It has always been Elon Musk: the stock, but even as a bull, I find that it can be somewhat too speculatively priced today. I took a bunch of profit earlier this year - but it turned out that I was far too early and missed out on a lot of gains. Tesla doesn't even have dominant market share in the EV space, and there are a ton of competitors from both the old guard to newfangled hot EV startups (ie. Hyliion, Rivian, Lordstown, Fischer, etc. etc.). Their gross margin per vehicle is solid and they are massively scaling up. Their revenue growth in solar is a little uninspiring. Tons of competition on the autonomous driving sector so no guarantees there. I would say hold for now - though there are opportunities to buy in when its oversold after missing on major catalysts like battery day.ÿg8uatg8

Cerebral23adÿStockMarketÿ2020-10-14 22:16:56ÿAs long as you don't plan to only have one stock it's not bad.  Think of it like a savings account.  Is it better to put $5 in a month, or $0?  I would say it's best to start with cheaper stocks that are stable then a singular stable large one though.  is TSLA is $400, and it goes up $1 you earned one dollar.  If you buy 10 $40 stocks that go up $1 you made $10.  But is simple terms, buying any stock is better than buying no stock waiting until you can dump tons into it.    It also minimizes your losses as you're learning.  Dumping $400 in initially and losing 10% is better than dumping $10,000 in and losing 10% due to learningÿg8uamqh

WeldAEÿSelfDrivingCarsÿ2020-10-14 22:16:03ÿ"What I found interesting and why - **Ride 2**:  * [Being able to honk the horn](https://youtu.be/tBJ0GvsQeak?t=1540) is both awesome and possibly terrible.  Hopefully Waymo rate limits it or something so you can't just lay into it. * [Traffic speed really helps](https://youtu.be/tBJ0GvsQeak?t=1779) in Phoenix.  Notice everyone is driving 43 in a 45 roughly.  In the Atlanta suburbs a street like this would be 45mph limited road but everyone would be doing 55mph+. * [School Zone] (https://youtu.be/tBJ0GvsQeak?t=1975) and notice the screen says ""Slow Zone"" in yellow to let the passenger know why it's going slow on purpose.  In Atlanta everyone would be doing 35mph but in Phoenix everyone else seems to be speeding and doing 45mph. * [No idea how Waymo picks lanes and when](https://youtu.be/tBJ0GvsQeak?t=2399).  Sometimes it picks the lane based on how it will turn 5 miles down the road.  Other times it changes lanes at the last moment like this example.  In general it seems to stick center but not always. * [Never seen anyone turn on a blinker for a cul-de-sac](https://youtu.be/tBJ0GvsQeak?t=2523), not even a school bus.  **Ride 3**:   * [Wow, the destination picker is really cool](https://youtu.be/tBJ0GvsQeak?t=2576) and I've never seen it before.  It seems both extensive and random with odd location omitted.  Not really a complaint, just trying to understand the logic.  More than enough options to the point of too many which almost begs the question why some places aren't allowed. * [Mask required even in an autonomous ride[(https://youtu.be/tBJ0GvsQeak?t=2588).  Seems like it would be easy to roll all the window down for a bit once the drop off is complete to air out the vehicle.  Might not have access to do that in a Pacificia.  Platform is everything, this would be easy for Tesla. * [Waymo is stalking you](https://youtu.be/tBJ0GvsQeak?t=2569), it's like something out of a horror movie.  From the time you hit search it was 12s before I could hear the wine of the thing approaching and 17s before it rounded the corner to pick you up.  That's faster than I could summon my Tesla from the parking lot.  Ok, I could probably get an Uber quicker than I could summon my Tesla but you get the point; it's faster than is should work.  You barely got done requesting the car. * [$1.36/mile is a pretty good deal](https://youtu.be/tBJ0GvsQeak?t=2626) * [I can see the construction zone](https://youtu.be/tBJ0GvsQeak?t=2812) and correctly determines which lanes are not usable.  Reminds me of the cones in the Tesla but they are actually cones and not hydrants and other random objects. * [Reckless guy](https://youtu.be/tBJ0GvsQeak?t=3629) and oncoming traffic is impressive for sure.  The guy was 100% in the wrong but I'm guessing he did it because of the awkward pause Waymo did after the big truck was clear.  Would love to know what the car was thinking during that entire turn. * [Skipped pedestrians] (https://youtu.be/tBJ0GvsQeak?t=3692) just like I would.  The front door of Costco is death in a car.  In Atlanta you just run out of gas after being stuck for 12 hours."ÿg8uaj8v

wherearemyfeetÿukpoliticsÿ2020-10-14 22:13:57ÿ"&gt; Yes. Exactly. Which is why Bt crops are now passing EU approval and are among the first GMOs approved for use in the EU. So if you want to do the same with another kind of modification, you need to demonstrate that that specific modification, the resulting organism that you create, is not harmful to humans, to the same standards that Bt crops have been demonstrated to be safe. Does that make sense?  And that standard has been the case for over 2 decades. The problem is the lack of consistency, because the law is based in protectionism rather than the actual science.  &gt; Well no, again that's kind of what I'm getting at. The mechanism is safe, which is why the mechanism is not actually restricted beyond normal controls to keep it out of general public circulation.   Except that the mechanism *is* restricted. And the mechanism *is* the only one that the law demands a label to denote its use, with no other seed technology requiring such a thing.  &gt; The kinds of modification you can make through selective breeding are not anything like the kinds of modifications you can make through GM. As I said way back, there's no way you're going to selectively breed some jellyfish fluorescent protein (or insect venom to go with my other example...) into a plant without engineering that through viral transmission or some other means.  You can engineer anything you like given enough time and resource. ignoring how ""jellyfish protein"" isn't a thing (if you want to be super technical, it'd be called ""a protein"" since none are exclusive to any animal, and using transgenics is simply because it's infinitely more convenient).  &gt; Tesla is up to something like $4bn in state subsidy already. And obviously it gets its money from private investors as well. If you want to operate in a society, you need to be expected to follow the rules of that society.  And those rules are nonsensical, harmful and protectionist, and therefore bad, which is my point."ÿg8uaayc

I do recognize there is a LOT more tech these days and I shouldn’t have separated ICE and EV’s.   When I first started reading Tesla’s email, I was rolling my eyes and thinking, “shocker, Tesla doesn’t want anyone else working on their cars.”  It was the statement from the NHTSA that made me want to at least ask the Tesla community.

QQpennÿMVISÿ2020-10-14 22:07:28ÿThanks for the quick response. Some follow up questions...  * What tools do you use to facilitate communication? That wasn't clear looking at your website. * When you say 'scale communication' what do you mean by that? How is it different from a press release or a filing? * Verifying share ownership. That strikes a chord - as that would be missing from reddit, stocktwits and other forums. How does that work? That would be a clear benefit, not sure I understand how that would work though from reading your website. How do you verify? * On the Tesla Q&amp;A, what's the difference between 'shares' and 'votes'? There's a significant gap between the two - so I'm curious as to what they measure.  On 'secret formula' - I'm also curious about why you separate long term investors from day traders - do you not feel there is value in a community that includes both perspectives?  Thanks.ÿg8u9l9e

panick21ÿelectricvehiclesÿ2020-10-14 22:06:20ÿHow is bad efficiency good? It should be joked about. You realize that directly relates to the money you pay per mile?  And of course if accept lower profit margin in order put a huge battery in so you can pretend it charges faster, that not exactly a skill move.  If you 'fuel' Tesla the same amount of time you can actually go further. Sure Tesla slows down charging faster by % but not by actual miles added.ÿg8u9gse

If war base, I advise prioritizing protection of defenses, especially key ones and introduce a kill zone (you already have something to that effect in the center with the tesla farm around the x-bow).  In any case, small bombs on the inside of the base don't do much except for foil barch and goblins (sometimes), so I'd put those outside the base in key areas to foil wall breakers.  A scout view of this base would show a vacant 2-tile section above your center-ish compartment, so the SAMs, red bomb and small bombs are wasted there since troops are likely to path around it (the air traps can probably stay though).  Let us know whether this is a home, trophy, or war base and you'll get better guidance.ÿg8u91e5

A competition to see who can make the most affordable battery powered car. BABA is another great long term hold as well. Lithium has been going through the roof as a result. Great markets right now.

tadswanaÿModelYÿ2020-10-14 21:58:50ÿ$1k! That's crazy, it's a 60A breaker and a short run of cable, parts couldn't be more than $50. It will be a little more if your switchboard needs upgrading to fit the new breaker (doubtful).   I hear you on the $$$ in their eyes if they hear you are installing a Tesla charger, maybe ask for quotes on installing a 60A circuit, and then tell them after that it's for the wall connector. The connection itself to the wall connector is about a 5-10min job, it's the cable run for the new circuit which is time intensive.  As EVs get more mainstream this price gouging will come down.ÿg8u8nb9

Tesla has a CCS adapter but somehow there is an issue with that in the US at the moment, but this will not be like that forever.  &gt; And the network will continue to grow faster simply because it's the actual open industry standard supported by all other car makers and suppliers.

Mango_Z14ÿUsedCarsÿ2020-10-14 21:45:40ÿYou are on the right track with getting a decently used vehicle. Used sedans are also much cheaper, so you should be able to get a deal.   Personally, I love EVs like Tesla, and even hybrids like the Prius and Rav4 prime.   However, I would be very hesitant to buy a used hybrid vehicle. A brand new Prius will easily last 100k miles, but eventually the battery wears out and needs replacement. This alone costs thousands of dollars, and that won't even get you the OEM battery.   In terms of brand, I would avoid Ford completely unless you randomly decide to want an F-150. All of their other vehicles are crap, and they are literally done making cars in the US.  If you want a good used Sedan, I would look into the Corolla or Camry. I had a friend who had to drive 1.5hrs each way to work everyday, and they did it in their corolla for years. They even ended up hitting a dear head on and it still ran perfectly and they sold it a couple years later. The Camry is essentially a more luxurious corolla, so it will have better resale.ÿg8u76yf
silverelanÿteslamotorsÿ2020-10-14 21:45:11ÿTesla is being forced to react to other players in the EV space.   First it was Porsche putting the Model S on its heels with performance numbers that were so good that Tesla had to announce the Plaid in October 2019.  Then Lucid came out with the Air with numbers so good that it left Model S over 100 miles back on 3rd party observed range tests. Following up on the range, Lucid then showed performance specs that made Tesla throw in the towel on the 2020 Plaid (coming Summer 2020!) and so now it's Late 2021. Finally, Lucid announced pricing that undercut Tesla by $2000 so Musk announces they're dropping prices again. Why is Tesla so reactive and not leading with their performance and price?ÿg8u752w

merryman1ÿukpoliticsÿ2020-10-14 21:44:53ÿ&gt;You mean like Bt crops? The ones that exist now that produce pesticide? We know that Bt is safe for humans currently, because we know how it works as a pesticide and that it doesn't hurt humans  Yes. Exactly. Which is why Bt crops are now passing EU approval and are among the first GMOs approved for use in the EU. So if you want to do the same with another kind of modification, you need to demonstrate that that specific modification, the resulting organism that you create, is not harmful to humans, to the same standards that Bt crops have been demonstrated to be safe. Does that make sense?  &gt;They're not just throwing random genes and and seeing what happens.   Who is 'they'? Scientists? That's not really the concern of the regulator. Their concern is setting standards specifically for poor judgement, lack of forethought etc. You don't *want* or even *expect* those things to happen, but there still needs to be adequate protection *just in case*.   &gt;We know that the mechanism is safe (hence why the *blanket* ban is nonsensical) but the individual changes are fine, because they produce a very specific outcome and we know what that is ahead of time.   Well no, again that's kind of what I'm getting at. The *mechanism* is safe, which is why the *mechanism* is not actually restricted beyond normal controls to keep it out of general public circulation. What is restricted is what you use those safe mechanisms to actually produce to put on the market. If there is a specific outcome, then rigorous testing is the only way to demonstrate that. That's the whole point. No different to developing pharmaceuticals or any other bio-product. You can schematically work out ahead of time what you expect a pharmaceutical or drug to do, but you still need to actually test that and prove there isn't some other unforeseen interaction going on or else you're just taking someone's word for it. That's not good science.  &gt;If the direct and specific change that GM brings is too risky, then the truly random and uncontrolled change that you get from, well, every other seed tech must be Frankenstein stuff.    I get your point but again it just doesn't follow through. The *kinds* of modification you can make through selective breeding are not anything like the *kinds* of modifications you can make through GM. As I said way back, there's no way you're going to selectively breed some jellyfish fluorescent protein (or insect venom to go with my other example...) into a plant without engineering that through viral transmission or some other means. That's why there are different standards. And like obviously normal commercial seed breeding is still actually pretty regulated in the EU if you look in to it, its not some kind of free for all lol.   &gt;Except nobody's investing money except Tesla.   Tesla is up to something like $4bn in state subsidy already. And obviously it gets its money from private investors as well. If you want to operate in a society, you need to be expected to follow the rules of that society. The standards the EU set were, rightly, very high and put consumer concerns above vague notions of market development. We have the capital and manpower to do that whenever the need arises. We also have the means and the luxury of ensuring we do that in a way that is controlled and safe for the environment and general population. That is not a bad thing.ÿg8u73wz
afishinacloudÿelectricvehiclesÿ2020-10-14 21:44:33ÿSlightly off-topic. Skimming through this channel’s videos, they have compared Teslas to a bunch of ICEVs.   I’ve been noticing with car review channels like these that non-Tesla EVs typically only get compared to other EVs, but they’ll happily throw a Tesla up against popular fossil-fuel competitors.   For more people to seriously consider EVs, we need to see these other EVs being put up against ICEVs that people typically shop for, not just catering to people shopping for EVs. Not saying these videos shouldn’t exist, but why not also have P2 vs 3 series or ID.3 vs something like Focus or Corolla?ÿg8u72k8

CHICKENFORGIRLFRIENDÿkoreaÿ2020-10-14 21:43:51ÿThe NHS is a public healthcare service meaning it's free for everyone. Which is amazing and I think that other countries should have this system in place, but unfortunately with the coronavirus (and even before that in some cases), non-urgent medical care has taken a backseat so there are long wait times for cancelled surgeries, specialist appointments, etc.  I'm not sure how they prioritise things tbh. I had an emergency surgery here in the UK during the pandemic and I was rushed into surgery within a few hours. So I'm sure if it's super serious they would have seen people. But of course some illnesses are painful, and Gabie and Josh wanted children, so it must have seemed super serious to them.  I do wonder why they didn't opt for private healthcare, though. Especially when they'd just bought a Tesla.ÿg8u6zrk

im_thatoneguyÿteslamotorsÿ2020-10-14 21:42:43ÿ"&gt;It doesn't have billions of miles at its fingertips.    It only has a few million fully sampled (not labeled)    That's what I think FSD will be doing and why this next rewrite is essential.  Labeling, in order to provide rich metadata for searches of low confidence situations / disengagements.   If 99.9% of driving is disengagement free then Tesla has widdled down 10 billion miles to a manageable 10 million miles of interesting data.      &gt;  We use a perception system that processes raw sensor information and produces our input: a top-down representation of the environment and intended route, where objects such as vehicles are drawn as oriented 2D boxes    And how does a 2D box robustly express someone's hand out the window waving you to proceed.   Box\[a929f32b\].Window\[#DRIVER\].Gesture=#forwardWave.  Etc?  That's exactly the long tail that training on video not midlevel features would address.  The long tail IMO is not going to be solvable with bounding boxes and metadata flags.  Because you would need a near infinite number of metadata flags.  How do you ""generalize"" metadata for new situations when you're just solving edge cases by adding more metadata flags for missing metadata?  Even if it's unsupervised labeling it's still attempting to address an infinite number of edge cases using a finite number of labels.      &gt; To support it, and to best leverage the expert data, we used middle-level input and output representations which allow easy mixing of real and simulated data and alleviate the burdens of learning perception and control.   And Waymo also believes strongly in relying on human fine tuned hyperparameters.  Tesla has stated very clearly that they don't think Waymo's approach is scalable or possible to generalize to uncurated environments.      &gt; Third autoML is not unsupervised. They are talking about end-to-end training methodolgy and the tuning of hyperparameters and network heads to find the best combination of these parameters   That's not what they wrote.   &gt; We were encouraged by these first results, so we decided to go **one step further** by looking more widely for **completely new architectures** that could provide even better results. By not limiting ourselves to combining the already discovered NAS cells, we could look more directly for architectures that took into account our strict latency requirements.    &gt;   &gt;We found even **better nets** than we had before when we had just **transferred** the NAS cells:   The old paper was larger pre-trained components combined like legos and hyper parameter tuned/trained.  The latest paper is ""from-scratch"" completely original architectures.  So... why Dojo?   &gt; what **would have taken over a year** of computational time \[for AutoML\] on a Google TPU cluster only took two weeks \[using a proxy task\].   AutoML is obviously extremely compute intensive since you're both searching the weight space but also the architecture space.  So if Tesla wants to train on absolutely ludicrous amounts of video and use AutoML to simultaneously build its architecture (rewrite) then it's going to need a stupendously large training super computer: Dojo.    But, they need FSD because they need to bootstrap the E2E network up to FSD levels without human labeling another billion miles of mid level data.   So I think their loss analysis will be PlaidNet FSD to bootstrap their End to End network to expert level and provide self supervised hints for attention maps.  Like Waymo used proxy tasks for their AutoML, I think Tesla is going to use the FSD mid level proxies initially to push it in the right direction toward a known working solution.  And then let it run wild once it reaches parity or near parity.    I don't think anyone knows if it'll work.  It might fail miserably and be a total waste. But you can't do exactly what everybody else is doing and expect exponentially better results than anyone else.    Every substantial breakthrough has been from removing human fine tuned expertise from the loop, not adding humans.   I think Tesla will achieve very good Level 2 self driving inside of cities with Birdseye/Plaidnet.  I think they might achieve Level 3 highway driving.  But I think they're going to need mostly unsupervised End to End for nationwide Level 4 without just following Waymo down the detailed human curated domains.   Also note that Elon keeps mentioning a limit on amazing ML engineers and Karpathy always talks about how labeling has to be done by trained engineers.  Chasing 9s will explode a midlevel reliant architecture.   And historically humans trying to impose a midlevel architecture hits a ceiling that is only overcome when the whole system is free to be trained."ÿg8u6v6o

buenohombre24ÿFireÿ2020-10-14 21:41:07ÿEspecially for the fire community, it becomes harder to plan for long-term gains and reasonable income with individual stocks.

The way i see it, every kind of data Tesla sends/receives/stores are also to some extent present in other manufacturers cars. It should apply to all and it should be allowed for all owners to chose who gets to service a car. Untill cars start shipping with fusion generators, at which point, sure..

Heck, if you open up a Robinhood account, they'll give you a stock. You could just trade with that money until you want to add more, if you ever do.  I turned $300 into currently $876. I rode Bed Bath and Beyond from that first $300 to about $750, then started putting it other places once the economy started being less up-trending. Recently bought Tesla and Apple when they split, and have got returns.  You should never rely on your investment funds for survival.

Typhoon4444ÿstocksÿ2020-10-14 21:30:36ÿIn the UK and Europe, Tesla still has by far the best charging network, but there is reasonably strong competition. That's especially true on the continent in places like the Netherlands.  I do, however, see Tesla's charging infrastructure lead staying as a strong lead for the foreseeable future. Tesla install a greater quantity of chargers, with higher operating speeds, in relevant locations. The closest competitor in the UK would be Ionity, but their network is still in its infancy, yet even the network growth is slower than Tesla's. And the Ionity pricing structure is ridiculous compared to Tesla's reasonable pricing.   Other competing networks will often stick a single 50kW rapid charger in a supermarket car park miles away from the motorway. That really is no comparison to the supercharger network, IMO.ÿg8u5i00

It hid the additional 700 lbs well. Adjustable dampers were a highlight. The interior (without leather) was surprisingly mediocre, though exterior build quality was miles apart.

infinitelimits00ÿoptionsÿ2020-10-14 21:15:21ÿGenerally calls are assigned when it expires ITM (or like ATM and there's some pin-risk involved). If it hits the strike before the expiration, it's super super rare someone will go ahead and exercise it since they'll be paying the extrinsic value. Thus, it's highly unlikely you'll get assigned. There's a special case with dividends though which is an entirely separate question. But in general, no you probably won't get assigned early unless its way, way in the money and has no extrinsic value. If it's right at the strike, it'll have plenty of extrinsic value.   Just think of the premium as a past thing. At expiration, all that matters is the spot price and the strike price. The premium you collected is a previous cost/gain that doesn't matter for exercise purposes. So at expiration, if spot is above strike, you will get assigned like 99.9% of the time. The rare 0.1% may occur if there's some manual override by the counterparty.   Yea 1.4 is fine. That's a fair OTM covered call strike. It depends really more on the IV but a general rule of 1.4 sounds ok. I personally would do 1.2, but you said you are more conservative and don't want your shares called away. 1.4 actually is pretty good for a high IV stock like Tesla. For a low IV stock like Intel, I would do like 1.15 or something like that. And I'm talking about 1 month out options. But nothing wrong with 1.4 as a general rule on the conservative side.ÿg8u3r9g

car_veganÿteslamotorsÿ2020-10-14 21:12:50ÿYeah because they’re older and Tesla can produce enough for the entire market to have one. That’s the demand curve cars generally follow. Model 3/Y has been going up because they’re supply limited on what they can produce - so sales get higher every quarter, but for normal car companies they typically pop up at the start and never get to that level again. S/X demand will move more like this in the future because Tesla can easily satisfy total demand.ÿg8u3gtb

dancinadventuresÿPersonalFinanceCanadaÿ2020-10-14 21:08:26ÿ1) Income and debt matter most.  Gross debt service ratio  Total debt service ratio   2) Employment matters for 2y history pretty binary, you’re there for 2y+ or not. Working somewhere for 10y matters same as 3.    If you’re self employed you get more wiggle room since they know your “$60k” is more than someone’s T4 “60k”. Chances are T4 person pays for his car and snacks after tax. Chances are Self employer / Incorporated means those expenses come pre tax for partial or a significant amount.   3) Credit report is a function of your debt history for most part. So see 1.   4) If you make about $10k. They’ll lend you ~ 5.5-6x. Or 55-60k.   For every $1k in monthly service debt, about 180k gets knocked off.   You make 100k ? Cool here’s 550k mortgage.  You lease a Tesla for 1K? Ok nvm here’s 370k or so     Unless your a health care professional (surgeon / physician / dentist ) - then you get special process where they’ll throw money at you at rates not offered to anyone else.

kobronsÿcarsÿ2020-10-14 21:07:34ÿNerving the car later on. Tesla did exactly this with their 85kwh model s.   Quite a few of them got slower, charged slower and lost a good chunk of their range because when Tesla had battery problems with this generation and they didn't want to do a recall.    Also the whole the car isn't really yours thing can happen. If I remember correctly they disabled a car that vw bought and rolled back a car from someone who found future models therefore removing features from him that he already had. Oh and they disable all dc fast charging on cars that have been wrecked when they find out that you use it. Doesn't matter if it was active when you bought it.

ffejieÿteslamotorsÿ2020-10-14 21:04:50ÿAs a consumer - awesome. Love to see competition drive prices down.  But why? Why is TSLA so reactive to what Lucid is doing? They're competing against literal air right now. You can't buy a Lucid Air, you can only reserve it, and it doesn't arrive until *2022.* Come on, exercise some strength on price leadership. Model S is a better car right now than Lucid Air because it exists. If Lucid announced the Air would cost $50K, would they move the Model S price down to $49420? Of course not, that'd be crazy.  Whoops, Lucid promised that back in 2017: [https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/lucid-air-base-price/](https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/lucid-air-base-price/)  I'd like to see Lucid deliver a single car at $70K before Tesla started reacting.

WeldAEÿwhatcarshouldIbuyÿ2020-10-14 21:03:05ÿ&gt; Tesla Model S with Full Self Driving: Never had an electric car. I live close to multiple supercharging stations -   This is the car I'd go with.  My next choice would be a Model Y performance since you don't own a SUV.  The hatch on the Model S makes it pretty reasonable though.  You won't use the Superchargers nearby, you will just charge at home.  You need superchargers when traveling long distance only.  This is the big advantage Tesla has over the other EVs right now on the simple point A-to-B front.  While there are other charging networks, they are pretty rough right now and it isn't clear when they will get their act together.  The entire east cost corridor is shutdown right now for the other networks for upgrades as an example.  &gt; I really like their design but my wife thinks that its a bit bland for its price  I think that's fair.

bballdude53ÿpersonalfinanceÿ2020-10-14 21:00:01ÿThat’s exactly what I’m saying, risk and return do not scale linearly, otherwise going all in on Tesla would be a correct option. There are diminishing marginal returns to taking on more risk. What this means is there is a set of portfolios that exist that maximize expected return at each risk level. But the only way to achieve one of these portfolios is to be as diversified as you can be. If you apply modern portfolio theory you can literally calculate this set of efficient portfolios.   I should be clear about what I mean by maximizing diversification, I’m not saying to split assets evenly between the different asset classes. I’m saying to maximize the benefits of holding assets that are uncorrelated with each other.ÿg8u1z5z

If you have a standard AC power socket, you can plug the Tesla cable in and charge your car with it. Meanwhile, practically no house come with a DC outlet that accepts a USB-C connector, so to actually charge your iPhone you need to additionally:  * Have purchased and installed a faceplate that includes a USB-C port for said socket, or * Purchase an AC-to-USB-C adapter, or * Already own an AC-to-USB-C adapter  Which means that the contents of the box is insufficient to charge the device on mains power.ÿg8u1uy8

They were just saying they will get the FSD option.  &gt;  In many tests the drivers reported that the driver assists on Genesis (also Hyundai / Kia) work better than Tesla.  The G80 is an awesome car for sure, but it's assist tech is nowhere near a Tesla.  Even if we call them both as good, think about how they will compare in a year when the Tesla has had a dozen updates and the G80 is still the same.  You just can't compare them.  &gt; Also Tesla and the euro brands have issues too (probably bigger issues in comparison).  The Model S is 10 years old and pretty solid at this point.  They got all the Model 3 tech late last year so it's easily the best Tesla on the road right now as long as you can afford it.  The issues you hear about are with the Model Y, not the S.ÿg8u1t1m

The architect needs some convincing though, since his original design calls for a chocolate brown standing seam metal roof. The black/blue shiny shingle doesn't work as well with the more beige color scheme we have cooked up, so we might have to rethink the whole palette just to accommodate the roof.ÿg8u1m47
henrysaywhatÿinvestingÿ2020-10-14 20:56:54ÿ"I don't know much about real estate, but obviously in the stock market you have stocks that trade above and below the fundamental value of a business - so this is a good reason not to accept the current price. Amazon is an incredible anomaly and personally I think it's just lazy think to say, ""Hey look, Amazon also traded at huge multiples and look how well that turned out!"". Amazon is obviously a huge exception and I think it would be really hard to predict another one. In any case, Tesla and Amazon are fundamentally different. Amazon is a platform company which is what allowed it to grow as large as it has. Tesla is still just a car company, as much as people would like to meme that it is a ""tech"" company (and now a battery company?).   The fact that people idolize Musk as much as they do is a red flag for me. Yeah, he is a smart guy and has done some incredible things with Space X and Tesla, but you still have to look at Tesla as a business and Tesla stock as a stock. Tesla has to sell cars. People fanboy about how incredible Tesla cars are (they are very cool, I agree), but I don't see how this will translate to a majority of consumers wanting this car. Early adopters will always be interested in this stuff, but it's still a car business and Tesla has to cross the chasm which is no guarantee and difficult to do. It's just reading too much into the future to say that everyone will want a Tesla and that ""the competition *just can't* catch up"". I don't buy it.   And again, a stock is a stock. When they go up this fast and this hard, they tend to revert in the same way. At some point people are going to put their money into something that is trading at a better value than the insanity that is TSLA because stocks trade at insane multiples are too fragile. Just the fact that within a little over a month you had price movements of -30%/+40% is insane."ÿg8u1lsi

Are they out of their mind or am I just not understanding it.**  Original Post:   &gt;    &gt;  &gt; Hello guys, haven't been on Reddit much but I'm in an interesting situation with Tesla Buyout. Purchased a house a year ago with existing PPA SolarCity/Tesla 5.8KW system. Since day one from transfer, the billing and monitoring never worked correctly. It took tesla 7 months to finally get everything to work, even now its still glitchy. Then, in June at 5 year mark, I asked for buyout quote. Had to request it 4 times since they kept ""loosing"" the request. Now comes Mid October, finally get buyout offer dated early September valid from09/24/2020 to 10/24/2020, only 10days form now. But that is just the beginning of the craziness. &gt;  &gt; The quote for my 5kw system that hasn't worked correctly since day 1 is 24K plus tax! In contract signed, its clearly written that the value is based on: FMV of the SYSTEM. System being the key word, not the value of contract. Since Tesla sells 8K solar system for 16K now days (without incentives and whatnot), wouldn't the buyout price be lower? &gt;  &gt; If anyone has dealt with such a headache, please let me know. Would gladly appreciate it     --- LocationBot 4.999987654321 7/51nds | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot) | &gt;!QUtV1ZTJDb1pVQ!&lt; | &gt;!MlMWVTSFpEci1WU!&lt;"ÿg8u19da

wherearemyfeetÿukpoliticsÿ2020-10-14 20:51:40ÿ"&gt; If I modify a plant to produce some irritant chemical to deter pests, I can be 100% sure that the process of modifying the plant itself will not necessarily be dangerous or harmful, but that doesn't then tell me if that irritant chemical, the actual modification, is safe or not.  You mean like Bt crops? The ones that exist now that produce pesticide? We know that Bt is safe for humans currently, because we know how it works as a pesticide and that it doesn't hurt humans, on account of us not having alkaline digestive systems. They're not just throwing random genes and and seeing what happens. We know that the mechanism is safe (hence why the *blanket* ban is nonsensical) but the individual changes are fine, because they produce a very specific outcome and we know what that is ahead of time.  Now if your follow-on response is ""well how do we know what that changes elsewhere"".... then if that's the concern then to be consistent, we'd need a blanket ban on all seeds realistically. If the direct and specific change that GM brings is too risky, then the truly random and uncontrolled change that you get from, well, every other seed tech must be Frankenstein stuff. But that's ok apparently. Almost like safety fears aren't the issue.  &gt; If you really want to keep hammering this analogy, it would be like the EU asking Tesla to actually produce some data showing that switching all cars in Europe to Tesla models would itself not actually cause an environmental catastrophe  No, because they're not banning VW's electric cars or anyone's hybrids or anything. Or if they did, it'd be like the EU being the leading organisation saying that electric cars are fantastic for the environment and the way forward while also banning them because ""but what about VW"".  &gt; The argument would be then that it would probably make a lot more sense to just invest that money into alternatives like public transport or facilitating reduced commuter volume  Except nobody's investing money except Tesla. And the idea that the EU would just be that dictatorial and say ""no, we're not allowing you the ability to choose to buy an electric Tesla because we decree you must take the bus"" would also reinforce the view held by Leave supporters that this isn't something they want holding power."ÿg8u0z7e

CogworkLolidoxÿCOMPLETEANARCHYÿ2020-10-14 20:49:40ÿ"&gt; Serving your country, your people is more than I, a singular person, could ever hope to achieve, you may feel differently, but I don’t feel the same.  I support serving your people. However, I not only refuse, but outright and permanently reject the concept of ""serving your country"". I see no reason to serve a country.  &gt; It is relevant because you can do something stupid and inconsiderate, such as not working, and while you are free to do so, there are consequences.  Correct.  &gt; But either way, where the desire to do something comes, the skill follows, and who is in front or behind doesn’t really matter  Yes. However, the person leading you and the people you are ahead of matter.  &gt; Then set up a co-op, but Tesla, Apple, Amazon, and others owe the worker no say in management.  Why don't they? Especially since the three examples here either have had scandals and reveals about their abysmal working conditions, or actively are using sweatshops. Even then, the workers there are still people. They suffer if their employment is cut. They suffer from decisions made by a detached management, looking more for profits than anything else.  Joining a worker co-op doesn't fix the systemic problem.  &gt; If the pay is to low then someone else will either be able to live it, or the pay will go up, it is simple supply and demand, there is demand for workers, if no supply for the price given demand goes up, and so does the rate, however someone else may be able to live with only that money then the demand is fufilled and the price either disappears or decreases,  Then how can sweatshops exist? How can some companies pay only the exact minimum wage, and still get employees?  &gt; blacklists can be called up, and then the business will give a reason, such as didn’t give two weeks, fired for poor work or something else, if you are a good employee you are unlikely to get blacklisted.  Employees that leave Konami are blacklisted by the company. Companies can and will issue fraudulent blacklists to prevent talent from quickly joining up with a competitor.  &gt; Entrepreneurs often go bankrupt, which will disqualify from many jobs, or if they can’t pay a business’ debts can go to jail, they risk their livelihood as well.  So can workers. If a worker gets bankrupt, it is incredibly hard to get a job. If they can't pay their debts, then they go to jail.  &gt; In my opinion(as a foreigner from UK), your silly ‘A vote for Jo Jorgenson is a vote for &lt;Republican or democrat&gt;’ is stupid and the fact that Americans buy it is them choosing Biden or Trump, neither of which I like, and only prefer one because he would help my country(but the incompetency doesn’t really pay into that, I don’t mind what the US does as long as it doesn’t concern me). And to say either is more incompetent than the other is lying, Trump has shown his overwhelming incompetence over the last 4 years, and Biden is so dementia ridden he can barely string a sentence together.  You think *you* find it silly? Or dislike how incompetent the American candidates are? I have to live with it. Also, third party votes don't do much in our system. We've gotten ourselves a two-party system, and, if one of the best and most liked presidents in our history, Theodore Roosevelt, couldn't win third-party, I doubt anyone will.  &gt; The thing is, what d I get from contributing to my community, economies should be blueprinted cold and emotionless, so every good action has more weight, and noone feels bad for not doing something, but feels good for doing something.  &gt; Everything you need to contribute more should either be able to be payed with loans(raw materials), or factored into your costs, if you can’t make a profit, change your proffesion.  Yes, it should! I agree with this, actually. The reason why you put resources into the community, as a communal resource, is because only those who actually give their fair share back or those who absolutely cannot work (disabled, elderly) should get access to the community's resources. That's why the phrase is ""from each according to their ability, to each according to their need"": it describes that people should give to the community from their ability, and receive what they need. Then, everything else that isn't a necessity can be handled through trading with others.  &gt; When there are things that control(unions, companies, militias) without a state, they become the state, and can then get corrupted like the Soviets, IWW without countries to restrict it would become a country(in my opinion), and that’s not good, hence why a strong government is needed.  No, that's why the people enforce the lack of a state. Anarchist communities need to be prepared to enforce and keep up the abolishment of the state, along with preventing the rise of one again.  The IWW lacks the apparatus to become a state, though. If anything, it would just help federate communities into one anarchist federation.  &gt; Calling things different things doesn’t change what they are, management check are bureaucracy, whether you want it or not, neighbourhood watches without police would grow to become new police, this doesn’t seem like anarchism, but an unstable bridge to communism of modern meaning.  Neighborhood watches don't necessarily become police. Without a state, they have nothing to become the police for, and with total community overreach over the watches, it's unlikely.  Just as well, we could impose a term limit upon neighborhood watch members, so they can't remain in power for long."ÿg8u0qmu

trsrogueÿlucidmotorsÿ2020-10-14 20:45:28ÿVery true. It seems Lucid is taking a different approach than Tesla at the same price point. Across their lineup, none of Tesla's competitors can really match their power/acceleration and (claimed) range. But Teslas are also quite lacking on interior niceties, which isn't everyone's cup of tea. So you could think of it as Lucid redirecting some cost that could go towards higher performance and putting it into a more luxurious interior. That'll certainly be preferred for some buyers, for whom 0-60 in a measly 5 seconds (actual number unknown) instead of 3.7 is just fine.ÿg8u08oc

DragnilÿAskALiberalÿ2020-10-14 20:44:56ÿ"I think he's right and wrong at the same time.  1) Why he's right. There are certainly people out there that plan to vote Trump but are embarrassed to say so. I don't think that's necessarily a good thing for Trump, though.  2) Why he's wrong. I think there are also a lot of people in deep Red districts who say they're voting for Trump but aren't. To understand this, you really need time living in the Deep South. Being Republican is as much a cultural hallmark of the South as being Christian or liking football. In all honesty, I'd be more comfortable being outed as an Atheist in most parts of the south than outed as a Democrat. Since Trump took office, I've met a lot of life-long Republicans who are planning to vote (D) in the next election, but they would never say so publicly.  To answer your last question, the Republican party has turned into a cult of personality. There are no principles, no ideology, no key policies, just support for Trump and whatever crazy new thing he comes up with next, at least this was the impression given at the RNC. Some Democrats on the far left have something akin to this with Bernie, but the party as a whole is less hierarchical and uniform than the GOP. Dems are also much more focused on ideology than a particular figurehead. For this reason, I doubt you're going to see someone driving a Tesla with ""BIDEN"" painted along the side flying BLM and ""Fuck Conservatives"" flags, while I see the Republican version of this at least a weekly basis."ÿg8u069z

It can deliver constant torque to high RPM (Rimac 848 Nm  of maximum torque available from 0 to 7400 rpm) so there is little point in putting a gearbox in there.   Developing a better motor makes more sense and leaves less mechanical issues and keeps the weight down.

tmaxElectronicsÿElectricalEngineeringÿ2020-10-14 20:36:39ÿthe main advantage of those is their inherently higher resilience to the temperature spike that occurs on the die as the device is switched while there is still current flowing. usually tesla coil inverters are driven as ZCS (Zero Crossing Switched), which allows the igbts to be used far beyond their maximum ratings given in the datasheet (mine have an absolute max of 600A and I have the current limit set to twice that). However for QCW Tesla coils (they basically have a long pulse, and a bus voltage slope to generate long sparks from a tiny coil as seen in this video) it can be beneficial to not use ZCS, as phase shifting can be used to emulate the bus voltage slope without needing a buck converter. This is the type of coil that I would need the SiC fets for ;)ÿg8tz6ko

TGUKFÿcarsÿ2020-10-14 20:36:26ÿ"Lol first of all, don't be so salty about fake internet points, second of all, I don't downvote people I disagree with on the internet   And I don't think governments would ban all ICE powered vehicles for a very long time. Like maybe 25 years after a ban on new ICE vehicles, which would probably be a conservative estimate on the length of service life for ICE vehicles/how long most people keep them, they could do a ban on new registrations ie ICE vehicles could no longer change hands. But it all really depends on the long term pricing of EVs. If you can't reach a point where a new EV can be as affordable for people who don't have the means to buy something like a Tesla or whatever as say like a Nissan Micra, which is like what 10-12k, then it's kind of hard to be like ""welp you can't have something old and used but that you can actually afford""  Not everyone is in a financial position to be able to buy something that's 30-40k+ new, even on finance or lease."ÿg8tz5mu

FragileLionÿteslainvestorsclubÿ2020-10-14 20:28:09ÿThe price already decreased a few days ago with 3K, now the decrease it with 2.5k extra. That's 5.5k for the customer. Doesn't seem like something to do just to share the cost savings. To maintain the same margins, you would pass on 25% of your actual cost savings. In this case that would be 4x5.5= $22k of actual cost savings. Pretty impossible.  And I do believe that price decreases in most cases are related to managing demand on the long term. Tesla knows they need a steady path down in pricing to maximize demand, profits and customer satisfaction. It's a very delicate balance. A 2-3k price decrease is very significant for gross margins, especially with Model 3/Y where we also have seen price decreases like this. They don't throw away 10-20% of gross margins just out of charity.ÿg8ty5km
penofguinoÿwhatcarshouldIbuyÿ2020-10-14 20:27:44ÿI was looking at these same models and doing research. I think I will end up going with the Q3, despite what is being said in this thread. I modeled the depreciation over time and brand wise it was less than the BMW. The Tesla probably depreciates less, but that is out for me because I need the gas for 15 hours drives I do every few months.   &amp;#x200B;  Q3 has much better reliability scores than cars similar in class including BMW and has excellent safety ratings. Those were the two things that really were important to me. My dealers offered financing specials with 0% which eventually saves me $5k over the span of the lease, which I can invest the cost of the car rather than pay cash and slowly recuperate more money during that time as well. Q3 I am only looking at 2019+ models and settled on a 2020.     Happy to hear differing opinions though, just give some actual points of clarification and not gut reactions.ÿg8ty3qt
crazy-gumpÿcarsÿ2020-10-14 20:27:20ÿ"Only if you want to increase your torque at low speed or improve top speed https://i.servimg.com/u/f70/17/67/16/75/courbe10.jpg  Electric engine torque is already at max from the start and is way higher than the torque of any ICE for the same peak power.  After 30% of engine rpm range it will ""loose"" torque to have a nearly constant power output. Acceleration slow down or become impossible as the torque needed to speed up is superior to the output.   A wise choice of gear ratio might allow to reach higher speed by shifting to engine rpm where its torque is not too depleted. If you reduce the engine speed by 20% on the constant torque range then you reduce the apply torque to the wheels by 20% (engine torque being equal) thus you will need a gear ratio such as reducing engine rpm by X% means increasing engine torque by more than X% (after the torque decreasing on the curve). As electric engine has a short low rpm and constant torque you will quickly reach a rpm with engine torque can't increase that much no matter how many gear you put.  It's the opposite of the ICE engine which is limited by its rpm as torque is increasing with rpm (or become nearly constant).   The appropriate power for performance needed with the high and instantaneous torque make having a shorter gear for heavy load nearly useless. Single case it would seem useful is you use it only for low speed trailing and improve acceleration with a low power car. Once again torque is really good on electric car and you don't really need this.  One other trick to improve torque is that you can choose more or less to use peak torque for an electric engine. Peak torque is about ~ 1,5x higher than nominal at the price of worse effectiveness and huge heat output. Most engine can't run long on peak with the debate around peak hp and peak continuous hp. For example Zero is selling bikes for 11 kW while peak power is 20 kW but horsepower for homologation is a continuous measurements.   You have another choice used by Tesla: different reduction between front and back engine. Back is low reduction for better accel while front is high for speed and power reserve if you want to speed up even more."ÿg8ty1vu
Rule_Brittania56ÿCOMPLETEANARCHYÿ2020-10-14 20:26:22ÿServing your country, your people is more than I, a singular person, could ever hope to achieve, you may feel differently, but I don’t feel the same.  It is relevant because you can do something stupid and inconsiderate, such as not working, and while you are free to do so, there are consequences.  But either way, where the desire to do something comes, the skill follows, and who is in front or behind doesn’t really matter  Then set up a co-op, but Tesla, Apple, Amazon, and others owe the worker no say in management.  If the pay is to low then someone else will either be able to live it, or the pay will go up, it is simple supply and demand, there is demand for workers, if no supply for the price given demand goes up, and so does the rate, however someone else may be able to live with only that money then the demand is fufilled and the price either disappears or decreases, blacklists can be called up, and then the business will give a reason, such as didn’t give two weeks, fired for poor work or something else, if you are a good employee you are unlikely to get blacklisted. Entrepreneurs often go bankrupt, which will disqualify from many jobs, or if they can’t pay a business’ debts can go to jail, they risk their livelihood as well.  In my opinion(as a foreigner from UK), your silly ‘A vote for Jo Jorgenson is a vote for &lt;Republican or democrat&gt;’ is stupid and the fact that Americans buy it is them choosing Biden or Trump, neither of which I like, and only prefer one because he would help my country(but the incompetency doesn’t really pay into that, I don’t mind what the US does as long as it doesn’t concern me). And to say either is more incompetent than the other is lying, Trump has shown his overwhelming incompetence over the last 4 years, and Biden is so dementia ridden he can barely string a sentence together.  I agree with everything you say on degrees, as long as you can pay back your loan, go get ‘em mate.  The thing is, what d I get from contributing to my community, economies should be blueprinted cold and emotionless, so every good action has more weight, and noone feels bad for not doing something, but feels good for doing something.  Everything you need to contribute more should either be able to be payed with loans(raw materials), or factored into your costs, if you can’t make a profit, change your proffesion.  Look at Libertarians, and other such groups, this respect has given them so much distaste to the communities that tbh it is economically sound to help, people need money to buy things and get an economy going.  When there are things that control(unions, companies, militias) without a state, they become the state, and can then get corrupted like the Soviets, IWW without countries to restrict it would become a country(in my opinion), and that’s not good, hence why a strong government is needed.  Calling things different things doesn’t change what they are, management check are bureaucracy, whether you want it or not, neighbourhood watches without police would grow to become new police, this doesn’t seem like anarchism, but an unstable bridge to communism of modern meaning.ÿg8txxsi

cheddarbenÿstocksÿ2020-10-14 20:23:25ÿBut I guess thats the real thing... I am not really arguing near term valuation, either.  Lets look at this. You say they are going to grow 50% every year for the next 10 years. Based on 2019 revenue, that would bring them to 1,418,560,000,000 in revenue 2029. That said, I do think that is fairly optimistic considering past predictions where he made predictions that don't fully meet what he says (like in Part Deux) and that this will likely be a *contraction* contraction year. But lets look.  OK. revenue in 2029 is 1.4 trillion.  Over the past 10 years, TSLA has diluted about 2500%. Lets give them the benefit of the doubt and say they only dilute 500%. They are currently at 931,810,000 outstanding shares and that would bring them to 4,659,050,000 outstanding shares. Mind you, that is likely being *very* generous considering AAPL (we are comparing, right?) was around 26 billion outstanding shares at their peak.   So in 10 years, in an optimistic scenario, we are looking at revenue of 1,418,560,000,000 and 4,659,050,000 outstanding shares. Keeping in line with AAPL, who had a P/S ratio of 4.99 on 12/31. AMZN was 3.32, for the record.  Lets do some long term looking at the P/S. What should the price of a share be with those sales, that outstanding share count, and that p/s ratio?  Market Cap/Revenue = P/S  (Outstanding Shares*PPS)/Revenue = P/S  (4,659,050,000 (PPS))/1418560000000 = 4.99  4,659,050,000 (PPS) = 7,078,614,400,000  PPS 10 years from now = 1,520  Maybe my math is wrong? I dunno. Let me know.  If we use Elon's high end of growth (or what you are indicating anyways) and are super generous about the amount of dilution that will happen, you can expect a price of a bit over 3x what it is right now, in 10 years.  You should be able to put it in a boring SPY or VOO and get about 150% during a similar time frame with *way* less risk, although if you use the last 10 years, you are looking at about 400%. Or even if one is to think tech will outperform similarly to how it did the past 10 years and you will get 1000%.  Could TSLA do way better than they even predict? I suppose. That said, using the numbers that you are telling me they tout along with established bohemeth company numbers, I see TSLA doing not much better than the market, and that presumes they are able to do the things they say they are gonna do.ÿg8txkry

So if you're trying to avoid the problem you described, spread the solar power out and keep it as close as possible to point of use.   If we put a 5 kW solar array on each of a million homes, and combined that with a 14 kWh Tesla Powerwall in each one, we could generate up to 30 GWh per day and bank 14 GWh of that for the evening peak, without building any new power plants. Total cost roughly $22.5 billion, or less than the cost of two 1.1 GWe reactors. Side benefit: that's a million homes at least partially protected from rolling blackouts or weather-related safety shutoffs.ÿg8txcdp

I’ve already made a drive to Texas and California this year from the eastern part of the Midwest and renting vehicles, to me, is a great way to lose money when you could’ve just bought a car that serves all your purposes. And those number can be tricky. For every car that doesn’t drive any miles in a particular day someone drove 58, for instance.   While I think EV’s are already a great option, the question in particular was about why invest into EV’s now. I have TSLA stock and definitely want it to do well, but what I think we’re seeing is a lot of investors buying for what EV’s *will* do. Not what they can do. Then we later justify it by saying consumers won’t normally have to deal with the issues EV’s have today.  The biggest problems are:  - consumers are always worried about the 1% chance. That’s why people still buy the rental insurance on cars. We want a car that can make that trip easily. Even if they never do plan a trip.  - lots of rural Americans don’t have access to EV pumps and many jobs require a lot of driving in equally rural areas. It may not be debilitating, but a farmer/plant worker/etc doesn’t want to worry themselves with going home every time they need their car back to full.  - the price is still a major drain on sales. The TSLA cars with good mileage are worth more than a lot of American’s mortgages. While you do save money on gas, that’s not what most buyers will be looking at when purchasing the car. They don’t see low cost gas. They see a vehicle that’s worth way more than they’re used to.  All this to say, EV’s are going to become big, but I think from an investing standpoint there’s a clock on EV stocks short-term. The moment we see any sort of slow down in what EV’s promised I think there is going to be a drop or stagnation in the market.ÿg8txb35

CreativeDrainÿWarframeÿ2020-10-14 20:19:21ÿGaruda's altar/Trinity's well of life on booben. Since those abilities make the target invulnerable and store damage, it makes for great Tesla Bank buffers. Combine that with armor strip/bonus armor from Bastille. Booben gets some survivability and great damage.  Also, Tesla Nervos/Bank goes really well with Concentrated Arrow Ivara. Some cc to get easy headshots and massive damage.   Fire Elemental Ward on Oberon for some extra HP to benefit from extra armor, electric Ward on Hildryn for great lightshows and nice cc.  Empower on Equinox for that juicy extra 80% power strenght for team support.  Expedite Suffering on Grendel. Using a high slash weapon like the Zhuge Prime or Panthera Prime, using his Nourished Strike buff and his grouping/armor stripping ability with Feast, you get nice damage.

The downside is that there might be changes, delays, etc * Whatever Tesla is selling in 2 years, this is even more up in the air, but at the very least it'll likely be cheaper and/or better than the current Model S. Maybe in small ways, maybe in big ways * Something else?

TheAzureMageÿchangemyviewÿ2020-10-14 20:09:33ÿThe problem of there simply not being enough resources there to take to do much is...common to just about every first world culture. The US has the most billionares per capita, and is an extremely wealthy country. If we do not have enough for redistribution to get significant gains, the same is obviously also true for countries such as China, which have far fewer billionares to take from, and far more poor to distribute to.     And when we discuss taking wealth, we are not simply worried about them leaving. Most of this wealth is tied up in ownership of companies. Of land, of building, of machines, etc. Consider a company like Tesla. Could you seize it, and distribute the shares evenly to everyone? In theory. Would it retain its value without Musk at the helm. Almost certainly not. Could all of those people sell off that stock? Not without reconcentrating that wealth in someone's hands, and who is gonna drop that money if they think it's gonna get taken again.      Yeah, you can always sell off the factory stuff for scrap metal and stuff, but that'd be pennies on the dollar. The amount of money you can reclaim in that fashion is tiny.ÿg8tvwc9

At this point, in my opinion, it's prove Tesla wrong rather than prove Tesla right.  Tesla has set the bar, if someone is going to come in an unseat them as the EV leader, great.  But they have to prove their ability to do that.ÿg8tvo7k

williambotterÿbrasilnoticiasÿ2020-10-14 20:03:57ÿ" Quando foi lançado, em abril, [o Model 3 da Tesla Inc](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/10/tesla-comeca-a-vender-model-3-autonomo-fabricado-na-china.shtml). era o veículo de nova energia (NEV na sigla em inglês) mais quente na China.   No mês passado, entretanto, um relatório mensal de vendas da Associação de Carros de Passageiros da China (CPCA) mostrou uma mudança. No topo da classificação dos NEVs, com 15 mil vendas em agosto, estava um minicarro de duas portas e quatro lugares movido a bateria, vendido por apenas um décimo do preço do Model 3 mais barato.   O minúsculo carro quadrado, conhecido na íntegra como Wuling Hongguang Mini EV, foi lançado em julho por um parceiro chinês da gigante americana General Motors.   O desempenho se repetiu nesta semana quando a CPCA divulgou seus números de vendas de setembro, mostrando que foram vendidos 20.150 Mini EVs, contra 11.329 Tesla Model 3.   Apesar de vender o dobro de veículos, o modelo de orçamento do Wuling não compete com marcas de ponta [como Tesla ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/01/tesla-passa-a-valer-mais-que-gm-e-ford-juntas.shtml)ou suas imitadoras locais. Em vez disso, ele tem como alvo uma brecha no vasto mercado de EVs de baixo preço da China. E se beneficiou de uma confluência de fatores, como subsídios estatais generosos e controles mais rígidos sobre formas não licenciadas de transporte barato de curta distância.    O Mini EV —que pode ser licenciado para rodovias, o que é crucial— está se mostrando especialmente popular nas regiões menos ricas da China, de acordo com a joint venture da GM conhecida oficialmente como SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile Co. Ltd. (SGMW) e localmente como Wuling.   Comparado com outras marcas de NEV como Tesla e a rival local BYD Co. Ltd., o Mini EV percorre uma distância muito menor, mas ainda respeitável, com uma única carga, viajando 120 quilômetros ou 170 quilômetros, dependendo do modelo. O BYD Qin EV pode rodar 421 quilômetros e o Model 3 pelo menos 468 quilômetros, de acordo com seus fabricantes.   Zhang Yiqin, relações-públicas da SGMW, disse que o Mini EV é normalmente usado por indivíduos para levar e buscar membros da família e se deslocar, ao contrário dos NEVs mais sofisticados, que costumam ser vendidos para locadoras. ""A maioria dos (nossos) compradores são pessoas físicas"", disse ele.   A empresa construiu mais de 10.000 estações de recarga para os modelos, a maioria localizada em regiões menos desenvolvidas como a região autônoma de Guangxi Zhuang e Henan, bem como a relativamente mais rica Shandong.   ### Vasto mercado 'low-end'   Fundada em 2002 como uma união entre a gigante automobilística estatal SAIC Motor Corp. Ltd., a General Motors e a popular fabricante de microvans Wuling Motor Co. Ltd., a SGMW há muito tem como alvo o mercado automotivo de baixo custo da China a partir de sua sede em Liuzhou, na região autônoma de Guangxi Zhuang.   Mas foi apenas neste ano que a empresa estendeu a estratégia ao negócio de EVs, lançando a linha Mini EV a partir de 28.800 yuans (cerca de R$ 24 mil), com um modelo mais sofisticado por 38.800 yuans (R$ 32.200)—ainda apenas um décimo do custo do Tesla Model 3 mais barato.   Esse nível de preço o torna acessível a uma parte da vasta população de baixa renda da China nas áreas rurais e do interior. Cerca de 600 milhões de pessoas no país têm renda mensal de aproximadamente 1.000 yuans (R$ 828,80), revelou o primeiro-ministro Li Keqiang em entrevista coletiva em maio, e uma pesquisa realizada por pesquisadores da Universidade Normal de Pequim confirma seus comentários.   A pesquisa, do Instituto de Distribuição de Renda da China, revelou que 42,9% de 70 mil famílias entrevistadas tinham uma renda familiar mensal por pessoa de não mais de 1.090 yuans (R$ 904) em 2019. Se essa estatística for válida para todo o país, seria responsável por mais de 599,9 milhões pessoas.   Mais da metade das famílias pesquisadas ganhavam entre 1.090 e 5.000 yuans por mês (R$ 904 e R$ 4.150).   De acordo com Zhang, os Mini EVs têm vendas mais fortes nas províncias de Shandong, Hebei e Henan, bem como na região autônoma de Guangxi Zhuang —que se classificaram em 9º, 17º, 23º e 25º lugares entre as regiões da China em termos de receita após impostos por pessoa no ano passado, de acordo com dados do Departamento Nacional de Estatísticas. Embora Shandong seja mais rica, a população das outras três regiões tinha uma renda disponível média anual de cerca de 20.000 a 25.000 yuans (R$ 16.600 a 20.750).   O apelo do Mini EV não é surpresa, disse Gu Zhihong, vice-presidente da fabricante rival de miniveículos Fulu Group.   ""Como o QQ e o Alto antes dele, o Mini EV se tornará um meio de transporte para muitas cidades e vilarejos de nível inferior, o primeiro carro para jovens ou o segundo carro de famílias"", disse ele, referindo-se a dois minicarros anteriores que também tiveram forte demanda.   ### Recuperação geral   As vendas do Mini EV da SGMW foram impulsionadas pela recuperação geral do mercado de EVs da China, que retomou o crescimento em julho, após uma queda drástica de 75% em fevereiro, quando o surto de coronavírus no país estava mais grave. Dados da Associação Chinesa de Fabricantes de Automóveis sugerem que um total de 138 mil veículos de energia nova (NEVs) foram vendidos no mês passado, um aumento de 67,7% em relação ao mesmo período de 2019.   A pressão do governo chinês para uma adoção mais ampla de NEVs no campo contribuiu muito. Um decreto de julho do Ministério do Comércio e de dois outros departamentos instruiu os governos locais a formular políticas de apoio aos NEVs nas áreas rurais.   Em abril, o governo central estendeu generosos subsídios estatais e incentivos fiscais aos fabricantes de NEVs —que enfrentavam a falência— por mais dois anos em uma tentativa de [reduzir as consequências da pandemia de Covid-19](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/09/china-cresce-na-venda-de-equipamentos-medicos-e-exportacoes-registram-maior-resultado-em-17-meses.shtml).   Com todos esses incentivos em ação, a Wuling foi apenas uma das marcas que apresentou resultados brilhantes. A BYD Co. Ltd., sediada em Shenzhen, vendeu mais de 19 mil de seus modelos NEV em setembro, ultrapassando a Tesla e ocupando o segundo lugar na tabela de vendas do mês passado, de acordo com os números da CPCA. As vendas do Tesla Model 3 ficaram em cerca de 11 mil por mês desde julho, enquanto rivais chinesas como Nio Inc. e Xpeng Inc., listadas nos Estados Unidos, mais que dobraram suas vendas no mesmo período.   Nio, Xpeng e Li Auto, negociadas na Nasdaq, quebraram seus recordes de vendas mensais em setembro. A última entregou 3.504 NEVs, enquanto a Xpeng, com sede em Guangzhou, vendeu 3.478, um aumento de 145%. As vendas mensais da Nio aumentaram 133,2%, para cerca de 4.700.   ### Alternativas limitadas   O interesse crescente pelo Mini EV da SGMW também ocorre quando as autoridades chinesas visam seus concorrentes no espaço de veículos motorizados de baixo custo, como triciclos e quadriciclos fechados, citando questões de segurança. Esses veículos, com custos mais baixos e requisitos de licenciamento imprecisos, são usados há muito tempo como alternativa para carros de alto consumo de combustível.   Com uma variedade de formas e tamanhos, os rivais tradicionais do Mini EV normalmente custam entre 10.000 yuans e 30.000 yuans e rodam em velocidades de até 70 km/h. Eles viveram nas sombras regulatórias da China durante anos, nem estritamente legais nem ilegais, e não exigem placas de licenciamento, apesar de serem grandes e velozes o suficiente para causar muitos danos.   Dados do Ministério da Indústria e Tecnologia da Informação sugerem que cerca de 18 mil pessoas foram mortas e 186 mil ficaram feridas em acidentes relacionados com quadriciclos em cinco anos, terminando em 2018. Os veículos estiveram envolvidos em 830 mil incidentes de tráfego registrados durante o período.   Nenhuma licença é necessária para operar esses veículos, o que os torna atraentes, mas também um investimento arriscado se forem proibidos no futuro.   O Ministério de Segurança Pública da China, que tem jurisdição sobre o controle de tráfego, se opôs à ideia de legalizar esses veículos, mas não chegou a uma proibição total.   Algumas autoridades locais tomaram suas próprias medidas, no entanto. Várias cidades da província de Shandong proibiram os moradores de conduzir quadriciclos este ano.   Um membro da indústria disse que era inevitável que as mudanças regulatórias levassem as pessoas a comprar Mini EVs, que são legais nas estradas e podem obter licenças de veículos motorizados. Isso também pode atrair outras marcas a lançar modelos semelhantes para competir no mercado de baixo custo, disse essa pessoa.   ""O Hongguang Mini EV reformulou o mercado de veículos de baixo custo com seus preços"", acrescentou a pessoa. A montadora anunciou que vai aumentar sua capacidade de fabricação para esse modelo para 20 mil por mês, na tentativa de entregar os pedidos no prazo.   Tradução de **Luiz Roberto M.

InvestingBigÿinvestingÿ2020-10-14 20:00:42ÿGiven that Elon has had to do 8 price cuts this year and 2 price cuts just within the last 24 hours alone it indicates there is falling demand for the cars. Gross margins are already only an industry average 18%. Factor in the latest price cuts and I expect them to be making even less per car. Now factor in falling demand and it is not looking good.   Tesla is already losing the EV king status in Europe as it's sales have cratered. China sales never materialized and the chinese government is obstructing them over local competitors. Of course, this is masked by musk saying he will divert chinese made cars to other areas like europe. Something he said he would not do.

wild_b_catÿpersonalfinanceÿ2020-10-14 19:56:45ÿKeep in mind, the question isn't whether Tesla has a great future, it's whether your opinion of its future is higher than that of the marketplace in general.

FuntimesInCountryÿteslamotorsÿ2020-10-14 19:56:42ÿMore thoughts on other differences: MCU in Raven is better. UI is smoother and more responsive. Screen is brighter and sharper on the Raven. In the 2017 MX, the screen looks faded and washed out a bit (like the one on my 2015 MS). Sound system seems much much better as well (not sure if the 2017 came with stock with the better sound system, I know it was an option on MS back in the day). I would say that the overall experience was noticeably better in the 2020 model. I think this just shows what others have been saying about the incremental updates Tesla pushes out each year. The cumulative experience of the improvements are not usually highlighted.ÿg8tudf1

Hydrol-Xÿkingdomrushÿ2020-10-14 19:54:11ÿI like to rush a ranger tower on the bend next to the graveyard, and max out its vines LATER so you barely have to worry about the skeletons. I then buiId two tier 3 wizard towers to the right of that (which will later be two arcanes or an arcane and a sorcerer) and place two teslas at the other two bends where the paths converge for basic wave clear, followed by arcane wizards on the bottom row and more rangers on the top. If you’re free to play and don’t have bonus heroes, use Malik. Have him level up in the top row where the demons spawn then move him to the middle row once he’s lvl 4-5.  Also, the only tower abilities you should be maxing pre wave 11/12 are ranger vines and tesla shockwaves. It’s better to have a lot of tier 4 towers with little to no bonuses than a few buffed up towers.  When Vez’nan spawns, make sure to keep slowing him with reinforcements (and make sure you have them max level too). That should slow him enough to kill him.  Let me know if you have any more questions!ÿg8tu2lt

Whether the market buys the product and whether the government provides regulations that facilitate the success of autonomous vehicles is another matter. I know my next car will be a Tesla, and anecdotally others I speak to say the same thing. I can't pretend a small sample size represents larger markets but laws are trending to EVs being the only car in the future and I feel fairly confident Tesla has a significant lead in the EV market.

MostlyCRPGsÿinvestingÿ2020-10-14 19:28:04ÿ"I might have misunderstood you, when you said ""crossover point"" I took it to mean the point at which Tesla's earnings brought its valuation in to a more normalized range, such that the valuation was a function of immediate future earnings rather than speculative rapid growth.  And that won't be 2021, because current valuations factor in years and years of absolute grand slam years for TSLA.   I make no claims to know the future value of Tesla.  I don't hold the position personally, but I have plenty of exposure through ARKK.  What I *do* know is that valuation driven entirely by hype and sentiment has the possibility to crash as quickly as it inflates.  Does that mean it'll happen?  *Absolutely* not.  When you're divorced from fundamentals who's to say it can't run another 100%?  When most discussion regarding the company is platitudes about the future and qualitative arguments what's to say it can't run another 200% next year?     All that's to say, I'll let Cathie Wood run that part of my portfolio for me.  Congrats on the big wins to all those who have ridden Tesla up the past couple of years, wish that money was mine but you made the right bet.   However, IMO taking a high risk bet and winning doesn't make the bet any less risky.    TLDR:  I think Tesla is valued to an insane degree right now, that said I'm not arrogant enough to think that just because I think it's overvalued that it will come down anytime soon.    EDIT:  As for Musk,  I'm not entirely sold on his cult of personality.  He's certainly accomplished some amazing things, but I can just as easily see him going off the deep end and/or doing too much coke and crashing his car as guiding his network of businesses to a long, happy future."ÿg8tr0zq

WeldAEÿwhatcarshouldIbuyÿ2020-10-14 19:24:42ÿThe XC60 is worth a look for sure.  I'd also look at the Acura RDX.  My recommended car would be a Tesla Model Y.  Reasons are:  * Autopilot is the best on the market and will do everything but turn corners and change lanes.  It is 10x better than any other solution on the market and it continues to improve unlike any other car you buy which will be the same as the day you bought it the entire time you own it. * It's the cheapest to operate.  Mind you this won't be huge since you drive so few miles but it's still savings. * Low hassle factor.  You won't need to take it to a shop until you need tires.  After that it's probably after 6 years when you need an AC service.  You will never need to visit a gas station again. For trips of 4 hours or less you won't even need to charge it on the road. * High resale.  Tesla's are depreciating around 5% per year currently.  There is no reason to believe this will accelerate.  Compare this to 20% just in the first year for any of the other cars you're looking at.ÿg8tqoe2

PeteSampras_MMOÿinvestingÿ2020-10-14 19:22:22ÿI'd agree with you. But I was a real estate appraiser at one point in my life and there were arguments that a property was worth whatever the market was willing to pay. If people are willing to pay more for a company then who's to say that isn't the value? Amazon has traded at 100x PE ratio for over a decade. At one point they had spiked to 3000 PE ([https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/pe-ratio](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/pe-ratio)) Would you say that people that invested in AMZN in 2013 when it was 3000 PE made a bad investment? Logic at the time says it is a terrible choice but hindsight being 20/20 is that it was a very good choice and even at that ratio the company was undervalued by a lot for long term.  Tesla is an Apple/Amazon type of company that is diversified and let by a goal driven CEO. Elon Musk adds intrinsic orders of magnitude of value and his cross company efforts such as SpaceX making the heat pump for Tesla has intangible values that other companies simply cant match. He's also Chief Scientist in addition to CEO. I'd not bet against Musk and have in fact, gone all in on Musk (and Cathie Wood for the rest of my investments).ÿg8tqfif

Jupiter-Tankÿcarsÿ2020-10-14 19:17:12ÿManual?  Probably not the most useful. Gearbox in general?  Yes useful, to varied degrees.   Electric motors, like ICEs, have effective rpm ranges. However, they are much larger, and start at zero. Still, they do top out. For most of the tesla line, it’s between 100 and 155. This is because the DC motor simply tops out at how many times it can discretely apply electromagnetic charge.   EV companies have tried to account for this by using larger tires/wheels to “gear up” the machine, or actually adding more gears in the case of the nio, taycan, rimac, etc.   It’s likely tesla’s newest lineup will also use transmissions with at least 2 gears to realize the higher top speeds, the better EPA rated range, and the faster quarter mile times due to maintaining a more constant acceleration curve.ÿg8tpuew

AdventurousTill5ÿteslamotorsÿ2020-10-14 19:16:51ÿLIDAR doesn't preclude the use of ML, LIDAR is just a bad idea because ML makes it unnecessary. In theory having more data, including LIDAR data, is always better, but in practicality that's not necessarily the case. For one thing there's the consideration of cost (the more sensors you add the more cost goes up). For another there's the issue of complexity (gathering, storing, and processing that data takes up resources in terms of both computing hardware and software processing). Visual only can do the job of LIDAR just fine so adding LIDAR to the data stack is at best unnecessary and at worst detrimental in some way.  The real problem with LIDAR though isn't LIDAR itself, it's the way companies have relied upon it early on specifically so they wouldn't have to go the ML route. A neural net on the scale required for FSD takes a long time to build, a lot of highly talented (i.e. expensive) software engineers, and a lot of cars on the road to collect the data needed to train the net. That's a whole lot of overhead that non-automakers don't have (with the exception of the highly talented software engineers).   So instead, tech companies approaching FSD tried to use the LIDAR shortcut to bypass having to build out a complex neural net. What they wound up with instead was a vehicle that uses LIDAR for basic collision avoidance and navigation and a much simpler ML computer that is really only good for basic object recognition (e.g. is the that object a stop sign, is that thing 5 meters in front of me in my path, etc.).   But that sounds like all you'd need for FSD right? Not so much because humans are infinitely better than that bare bones method of driving because humans have the ability to discern context like I was mentioning before. Humans know that if there is a wall 20 feet ahead at their 3 o'clock positon of an intersection a car might be behind it traveling perpendicular which might cause a t-bone wreck and therefore the driver needs to be extra cautious approaching the intersection. LIDAR-centric systems have no way to discern that context, which makes LIDAR-centric systems inherently less safe than a human driver in many circumstances. So you absolutely need that context for FSD to work at the level of reliability needed for mass adoption.   Well can't you just train the LIDAR-centric ML to have that context?  Yeah in theory, but the LIDAR-centric systems out now are so far behind in their ML development (remember their ML systems were originally just built for simple object recognition, not contextual clues. Have they redesigned them now to account for context? Maybe? I doubt it, but even if they have they're still behind because they relied on LIDAR too much from the start) and deployment (gathering data - Tesla has magnitudes more cars on the road gathering real-world data every single day for its neural net than all the other companies pursuing FSD combined) that it would be shocking if any of them managed to beat Tesla to a national (note that you see headlines of various companies deploying self driving in different cities at different capacities all the time. That's pretty meaningless. Compared to developing a vehicle that can self-drive on any street in the US, the prospect of developing one that can self-drive on any street in a single city is infinitely easier. Tesla is developing its neural net FSD solution for the big picture, long-term application, not for little one-off headline-grabbing deployments aimed to attract more investors.) level 5 FSD release.ÿg8tpsz4

What have you been thinking about in terms of connection and how you relate to the world?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Did you have a journey of internalizing it or was one of those that *really* clicked the first few times you heard it?   I think it's absolutely a been journey! And it'll continue to be imo :)  One that's always going and always giving you more experience and more references for understanding how everything works.  Ultimately I think the journey moves towards the realization that we're literally and figuratively all connected... On a physical level, societal level and energetic level. Your energy and your vibe affects the world around you, and gets reflected back at you. This happens on sooo many levels.   (Nikola Tesla said it well:  ""**If you wish to understand the Universe think of energy, frequency and vibration.**"" Just like the spiritual mystics and philosophers throughout the ages, and many more too, have discovered.)  Now that you got me thinking about...  I think a lot of the world we experience is just a reflection of ourselves. The way YOU express yourself and the way you consequently interpret the world.  So in a way... how you connect with others is how you connect with yourself ;)  Fucking dope thought eh?! I love it.   Hope you're having a good one bro!"ÿg8tphq4

Mr_CIeanÿEconomicsÿ2020-10-14 19:07:23ÿYour right their credits just represent a ton of their net income. Probably why they weren't added to the S&amp;P500.  And buy-side analysts when putting something out are selling you something. Their bear case is higher than any analyst on the sell-side has put out yet (only a handful have though).   I have no position in Tesla - I haven't kept the price down. It's very highly valued, even bullish investors have trouble justifying it at times. Good for you if you've made lots of money. I don't care. I just think people bullish are way ahead of their skis - just like people who are bearish are equally as outrageous a lot of the time.ÿg8toobl

You'll probably get much more use out of them than Deathmarks which are largely situational. You could also always proxy Deathmarks with immortal models if you wanted to experiment. If youre feeling adventurous, you could magnetise the arms and then you could make them gauss, tesla or death marks.. not sure if I have the skill to do that.ÿg8to5jx

throwawayawayayayayÿinvestingÿ2020-10-14 19:00:59ÿI'm really rooting for the company, but it's hard to see the case for continued growth in the near term given the low price of oil/gas and the high cost of every Tesla car.  Long term, I would be more concerned with their ability to operate as an actual car company - warranties, service centers, etc. all cost a lot of money and offer crappy low margin businesses, which every other car company has been saddled with this whole time.  If they achieve their goal of fully autonomous driving, that seems like it would be a huge negative impact to the business seeing as how the world would need significantly fewer cars.  Maybe every vehicle on earth would be a Tesla, who knows.  The only thing I see that could justify the price and growth rate of the stock is if Musk has a secret plan up his sleeve to wrap the sun in a Dyson sphere and resell its energy to everyone on the planet.  Beyond that, I don't really see where they're getting their future margins from.ÿg8tnwsh
Bhaelrosÿiphoneÿ2020-10-14 19:00:30ÿThat is not similar fashion. At least Tesla has means to charge without buying something extra, be it slow or fast, doesn't matter.  Apple gives a USB-C to Lighting cable, nothing more. My power strip has only USB-A, like %99 or even %100 of power strips. My adapters are only USB-A. My PC and laptop has only USB-A (latest generation has one or max two USB-C ports)  Worse part is, Apple removed charging unit, Earpods and made boxes smaller, saying they are protecting environment by doing so, but price is still same. Why?  &amp;#x200B;  They are like Paris Hilton. Apple is literally saying, if you are poor, stop being poor.ÿg8tnuoh

PW saved our butts during 2 power outages, my app shows lifetime battery backup of 65 hours.   Install was a cinch, we had our SolarEdge inverter inexplicably fail (apparently our Gen / model had a slew of failures, not just Tesla installations). This was early in COVID and they warned me it could take a couple of weeks, and it ultimately took 20 days from failure to replacement, but I blame a lot of that on COVID delays.   Otherwise it’s been awesome, no complaints.ÿg8tnsl4

OnTheGround_BSÿstocksÿ2020-10-14 18:59:22ÿAgain, read the OP’s original request.  He wants to buy today and sell by this weekend for short gains.  I’m not just recommending Tesla because I’ve gotten ridiculous gains from it, I’m recommending it because it fits his specific needs.  It has a specific short-term catalyst which I am confident based on its history will propel the stock upwards through the end of the week and into next week.  I also recommended selling no later than the 20th because the stock is inherently volatile and likely will come back down after the 20th.  It was good, sound advice tailored to the OP’s specific needs.  He doesn’t need to worry about dividends, PE ratios, or market caps when he just wants to hold for four days and cash out.  The stock won’t put him in debt for years just because he bought and held for four days during a week leading up into what’s expected to be a very strong quarterly report.  If he’d asked for a long term hold I’d probably would have suggested something else.  Now, we have a red day but my Tesla is still up over 3%, and over $450 for the first time since before the split.  The only stock in my portfolio doing (surprisingly) better is Hyliion, which I wouldn’t recommend to my dog for short-term gains.  I think I gave a well-thought and well-reasoned suggestion tailored to the OP’s request, absolutely appropriate for the topic at hand.  All you’ve done is trash Tesla and my trading abilities (which you know nothing about).  YOU are the reason this forum is going downhill, not me.  Either contribute to the conversation by recommending another stock you are confident will perform strongly upward this week despite all the other chaos going on, or shut up.ÿg8tnpvi

robotzorÿgifsÿ2020-10-14 18:55:48ÿTest drive a Tesla Model S (and next year, Plaid version) and you'll get the same thing with no waitÿg8tnaef
m4rc0n3ÿelectricvehiclesÿ2020-10-14 18:55:29ÿ"2 years ago, the Tesla Model S with the 100kWh battery had a range of 335 miles. 1 year ago, it had a range of 370 miles. Now, it has a range of over 400 miles. It's essentially still the same car though, and these range increases were due to relatively small, unannounced changes. Over that same period, the price dropped by about $20K.  Since you mentioned the ""Plaid"" Model S, keep in mind that the performance variants of the Model S have so far all had substantially \*lower\* range than their non-performance siblings. In other words, if the high performance ""Plaid"" Model S is going to have 520+ miles of range, which is what Tesla currently advertises, then a non-performance ""long range"" version will likely have even more range.  Given Tesla's history, it doesn't seem implausible that a 2022 base Model S will cost around $55K and have a range of well over 500 miles. So then in 2022, would you buy the $70K car with a 400 mile range, or the one that has vastly more range for a lot less money?  My guess is that when this car comes out in 2022, Lucid will have to offer it at a lower price than what they're saying now."ÿg8tn906

_fauxfoxÿinvestingÿ2020-10-14 18:54:18ÿI think electric cars are obvious, and Tesla has a massive lead. The iphone generation will like driving a tesla. If FSD is 100% completed, this will be bigger than apple. Combine that with lowering costs as they develop manufacturing.   Then there are all the other sectors elon/tesla is involved in, even using some spacex materials in the cybertruck. Is global warming not a thing? You do not bet against global powers trying to make something happen. For example, california banning internal combustion engines by 2033 or someshit. Every 15th car in downtown Hong Kong being a Tesla, and last quarter being the most sold car in Hong Kong.  It's not just a company pushing this, it's getting governmental support such as subsidies.ÿg8tn3ea

They have shown they can build a factory from dirt to car in about a year (CN).  So, you think people are going to quit wanting Teslas?  If anything, it will get easier for Tesla over time as regulatory tailwinds ensure they can sell every car they produce.  Tesla grew their $350m in credits per qtr to $430m in credits per qtr, on $25b+ annual revenue.  Saying ""a lot of Tesla's revenue growth has been through the sale of credits"" is just asinine.  Extrapolated, credits growth are 0.32b of their 25b revenue or just over 1%.

b00nzorÿelectricvehiclesÿ2020-10-14 18:50:43ÿNo, ICE cars are not cheaper, they are lower price with constant things that have to be done to them like oil changes, if they're diesel then you need to put additives in it, gas is WAY more expensive and people don't just buy cars from their wallets, they get a loan which makes having an EV car better.      Tesla already has cars that go as far as ICE and with their new batteries will go farther. What ICE cars can go 400 to 500 miles on a tank? Tesla also lets people copy their batteries, legacy companies don't make batteries and just have someone else make them, which if you have read reports then they have impurities that make their range less then it should be.     Its not just Tesla, its a whole new wave of automotive companies.     The eGulf is the same price as the Gulf. There have been cheap EV's that are cheap for a while. The people are IGNORANT so they get ICE.      The whole doughnuts and salad makes no sense, do you want to try that comparison again?     Car Firms are filled with idiots who take wrong data to come out with an answer. They take small sample sizes and then make that the bases for the country. Even investment firms are filled with idiots who want us to stay how we are. I don't think you know how dumb the average officer of a company is and how stupid Wall Street is. They were saying for the longest time that the Taycan is better then the Model S when the S basically beat it a month later and is over all a better car.      If you think that congress will actually do this then you're as ignorant as the people that buy ICE cars, even though you have an EV. I know, I'm an asshole and a dick to people and people say that I'm wrong, but nobody has come up with any reason why they are right and I am wrong.

PeteSampras_MMOÿinvestingÿ2020-10-14 18:50:24ÿOverweight Tesla bull positioned long here. Tesla is overvalued for today's earnings. I don't think anyone is questioning that aspect. Tesla is undervalued for long term, but determining the crossover point is less clear. Is it 2021 or 2022? 2025? 2030? The future value is already baked in up to that point and it seems like it is going to keep going up with the earnings call and inevitable S&amp;P 500 inclusion. I am currently 88% portfolio into Tesla and will likely not buy any more directly for awhile because obviously that is super overweight into a single stock (will get some indirectly via ARK ETFs and maybe CWB that has Tesla securities). I also won't be selling any because I can't see the future to know if or when the price will ever be better valued and I already missed the boat on getting it at $50.  All that said.. Tesla is an energy/tech/manufacturing company that just so happens to be applying that to cars. They've demonstrated demand is far outpacing supply and they are rapidly expanding production to meet it. Long term their vehicles direct sales are projected to be a small slice of their overall value with battery, solar, energy, insurance, cars, software, ridehailing, and hvac (plus whatever else they come up with such as aircraft). In fact, their margins should be significantly better in their non-car lines of effort. If they can capture even 50% of their stated 20 million car per year goal by 2030 and if full self driving is in effect.. then they will easily generate a trillion dollars (with massive profit margins of 25%+) in revenue just on their battery day projections.  So comparing Tesla to car companies is not going to get a proper valuation.. and more importantly remember that these car companies have been paying dividends for decades. That has significantly decreased their stock prices and company valuations while simultaneously bleeding off money that could have been used to R&amp;D battery electric vehicles. The ICE companies have done this to themselves and are now weakly positioned to catch up. Ford and Chevy in particular could be trillion dollar companies had they not paid dividends and focused on making better products over the years instead of making minor tweaks for short term profits. How is a company around for 100 years and doesn't invest in vertical integration? It is painful how obvious all this is when you look at these legacy automakers.ÿg8tmlwb

MrMagistrateÿeconomyÿ2020-10-14 18:44:39ÿDot com bubble survivors - Amazon stock fell 90% from 2000 to 2001 and has gone up 33,500% since then. Apple fell 70%, has gone up 45,000%. Microsoft fell 50%, has gone up 800%. Adobe fell 75%, has gone up 3,000%.   Some of the companies did have massive potential, but clearly not all or even most of them. Tesla is a single company with a proven history and clear business model rather than a basket of startups entering the unknown. The thing is that if Tesla can achieve its development goals, and it appears to be on track to do so, then it’s still massively undervalued. A lot of the dotcom busts were overvalued even considering realistic best case scenarios.   Disclaimer - not a Tesla investorÿg8tlxe2

Combined cycle gas plants are amazingly fast, but batteries ramp up at the flick of a switch. the [Hornsdale](https://electrek.co/2018/05/11/tesla-giant-battery-australia-reduced-grid-service-cost/) battery pack seems to confirm this, with 2% of SA's total capacity raking in 55% of revenues.   Profitability at scale may not even matter.  As suggested [here](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/broad-reach-power-starts-building-biggest-batteries-in-texas), batteries are also supplanting gas peakers in other markets, including Texas.

I don't remember any of the Japanese or European automakers getting bailed out.  If American companies can't run themselves in a way that makes them more able to withstand recessions, then why \*shouldn't\* they be allowed to go under?  We'd be better off letting foreign corporations buy up what's left of them.  \&gt;As you mention, we didn't have a proper safety net.  Right, and whose fault is that?  The voters'.  If they wanted a better safety net, they shouldn't have voted for politicians who call such things ""socialism"".  \&gt;If  GM suddenly can't pay hundreds of bills, those businesses are in deeper  trouble too and might not be able to pay their bills.  It's a ripple  effect the economy probably couldn't handle.  Yes, and that's fine.  Those companies can go bankrupt, and better-managed companies can buy them out.  I'm sure there's plenty of Chinese companies that would love to buy up American companies for pennies on the dollar.  \&gt;It's a ripple effect the economy probably couldn't handle  And that's fine.  The American voters didn't want ""socialism"", so they shouldn't get it.  When something really bad happens, they shouldn't have any kind of bailout, because it's not what they voted for or what they wanted.  If that means totally destroying the whole economy, I'm OK with that.  To do anything else is hypocritical, and nothing is worse than being a hypocrite."ÿg8tl4g2

smckenzie23ÿTeslaModelYÿ2020-10-14 18:20:31ÿI can't sort out how things work at Tesla by looking at the data. I'd heard, and assumed, that they made builds in huge blocks of the same. But looking at the assigned VINs over the last 4 days, and every possible color was built. There seems to be no pattern that I can figure out: color, wheels, tow hitch... I guess there have been no Performance for some time.  Similarly, I don't see obvious patterns in where the customer lives.   Very confusing.ÿg8tj1gq

Closed PENN 10/16 60/65 P credit spready for \~35% profit over 14 days 3. STO RKT Buy / Write 10/23 23.50 C for 1.24, I did this yesterday and I think this is easy money - good company. 4. STO DKNG 10/30 41.00 P 5. STO 4x VXRT 10/30 6.00 P 6. Rolled my TSLA 10/16 470/480 C credit spread to 10/23 520/540 for a credit of 0.6.  I got a little nervous TSLA kept on going up and up...but I got an extra 13% OTM cushion over a week.  This new expiry goes through earnings which makes me nervous...but I still contend that TSLA won't make new highs.  It has a PE of 1000 and I think today's move is just in response to the upgrade in NIO.  Thank goodness for high IV to make this roll work, although I had to widen my spread.  I also have an open order to close another ZM 10/16 550 / 560 C credit spread, hoping it fills soon.  It's right around 50% profit for me.ÿg8til2z

sabasaba19ÿteslamotorsÿ2020-10-14 18:15:39ÿI commented about B the other day. If it persists try to tape some streamers to test it out. Also cross reference the driver side to confirm equivalent behavior. There are a few closely placed slats but they’re different outputs. I could hold my hand up and sorta feel air coming out so it can feel like there is not really a problem. It wasn’t until I got all anal about it and placed multiple streamers *between* the individual openings to investigate that I could show the problem. I really could show air was coming out of some slats but not others, and I could compare it to the driver side. If they didn’t take apart the glove box and dash area and simply felt for air coming out, they could miss the issue. Air does come out but it’s not not as strong as it should be and not as directed as it should be. I was worried I was crazy after a second road trip when we couldn’t keep the driver and passenger comfortable because of the AC difference, after Tesla has concluded there was no problem. I think you also said you had a June 2018 build which I think is the same as mine (or within a month or two). Unfortunately I don’t seem to have any record of the invoice for that visit when they did the repair.

What about WW2 where the lives of literally millions of people are on the line as well as the threat of a fascist nation conquering the entire West? What about the Korean War where a similar threat attempted to invade and conquer a neighboring nation? I mean if you’re going that route, Switzerland is very neutral too.   America is ranked number one in the world in: military budget, military power, GDP, scientific papers published per year per capita, space program spending, moon landings, orbiting satellites, rovers on extraterrestrial bodies, immigration, and number of top ten universities in the world. I honestly could keep going. America is also home to a ton of highly innovative companies, for example: Apple, Microsoft, SpaceX, Boeing, Lockheed-Martin, Intel, AMD, Amazon, Ford, GM, Tesla, Google, etc.   America is an undisputed economic, cultural, and military superpower. It’s been the world’s largest economy since the 1860s, and it went from a ragtag group of colonies to a military superpower in less than 200 years.   And I looked it up, Switzerland supposedly holds the title of “No. 1 country” currently, not that the ranking actually means anything.ÿg8thism

Inherentlysubjectiveÿstocksÿ2020-10-14 18:06:22ÿSo many people on here with MSFT - like maybe even more than any other tech stock besides TSLA?  I've been watching it, but it has been hovering around 210-220 for little while now, don't know of any reason it might make big moves, am I missing anything? Or is it just a solid bet that they're not going anywhere, aren't screwing up big-time and they'll continue to succeed as most big tech companies are and at least as well as the economy? It seems like it to me, but I am only passingly familiar with what they are up to nowadays.  Satya Nadella seems like an excellent CEO and fit for them in particular, but only insofar as I've heard him on podcasts talking about his philosophy and strategy. I haven't looked that closely into his record.  But, they don't have a big streaming platform - for either TV/movies or livestream, their app store seems entirely irrelevant and they seem to be dropping services left and right (pivoting is good when they don't compete, don't get me wrong - this might be the wisest choice in all cases), no social media (no TikTok either), no self-driving car (?), but they got Azure into the fold before they were left behind, and they continue to invest in using new technology to support other businesses in a way that seems like it has a lot of potential, perhaps moreso than being consumer-focused, and they seem happy to do some good old anti-competitive acquisitions that will probably pay dividends.

Tesla extrapolated the data to predict that the vehicle would have reached 430 miles of range before the vehicle had shut down and had to be towed away on a flatbed.

They didn't sell the model 3 back then... so that means not very many cars were sold that year...  For the past 5 years, the CAGR on sales has been about 50%. Even the best estimate for sales in 5 years by an analysts is a CAGR of about 30%. That's great growth btw... just not 60+%  Also, a lot of Tesla's revenue growth has been through the sale of credits. That's not necessarily sustainable or impressive. It works for them but it shouldn't be part of their growth story as a company.   Also, not worth it to compare Apple to Tesla. Way different stages of being a company. Tesla has growth. Apple has huge free cash flow yield and buybacks a ton of shares. That's not to say Apple or Tesla is not over priced here... both can be but just looking at revenue is ridiculous.ÿg8tgkmp

PM_ME_UR_Definitionsÿteslamotorsÿ2020-10-14 17:57:51ÿ"Oh, so it's only data that's sent somewhere wirelessly by the car that this effects??  It seems like both sides arguing for and against this measure aren't really talking about specifics or concrete changes this will have.   The actual legal language is [here](https://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/elepdf/IFV_2020.pdf) (PDF), starting on page 5. I'm going to read it over and try to make sense of it.  Edit:  The more I read this, the more complicated it sounds. Why is it so specific? What exactly are they trying to solve? It seems like there's already a ""right to repair"" law in effect, and this is closing some loophole? But it sounds like they're trying to accomplish something very specific, and I'm not sure what the point is?   * They keep mentioning that the data needs to be accessible via a mobile device, but I'd assume that would mean it could also be accessible by a computer as well, and it doesn't specifically say that the mobile device needs to access it wirelessly? * It seems like the data that's sent wirelessly somewhere, could also be accessed via a physical connection by the owner, and that would be OK? * I'm not entirely sure if the connection needs to be standardized across all cars sold *by everyone* in Massachusetts, or if it needs to be standardized across all of the manufacturers makes and models? * The part about requiring the owner to give access to a repair shop seems complicated, and would really only apply to wireless access to the data? If it's physical access, then I don't know if just dropping off the car would count as ""giving access"" or would there need to be some additional step? * This would only apply to “Mechanical data”, so I don't think it would apply to things like GPS location data, or video from the cameras? Some parts are a little vague, and if read in a very broad way, it might include *everything*, which seems like a crazy amount of data. Other parts seem to make it clear that it's "" used for or otherwise related to the diagnosis, repair or maintenance of the vehicle. "" But again, that could be interpreted very loosely?  As it applies to Tesla specifically, I think that having access via the ODB2 port might actually satisfy every requirement? There's already adapters that are made for Teslas that connect to the ODB2 port and include a USB connection, and allow access to just about all ""mechanical data"", and can even send commands to things like doors and air suspension. It doesn't allow access to things like GPS data or videos (which hopefully isn't required anyways?), and its a standardized port, so that's good.   If this passes maybe Tesla would just have to include an adapter with every car sold in MA? Or potentially one that includes a bluetooth connection to make it ""directly accessible by the owner of the vehicle through a mobile-based application"" ??  Really the only thing that's concerning is the incredibly vague definition of ""Telemetrics System Data"", which includes ""any system in a motor vehicle that collects information generated by the operation of the vehicle and transmits such information"". Which would seem to include things like location, camera data, maybe even things like FSD inputs and outputs? It's so vague that I could see Tesla doing something like not collecting any of that data from cars bought in MA, to not be required to make it publicly available? Or just decide to not sell cars at all in MA, do something like Texas where you don't actually buy the car in Mass, and have to get it temp registered in CA and delivered there or something?"ÿg8tgbe8

AdventurousTill5ÿteslamotorsÿ2020-10-14 17:55:12ÿDepth isn't the problem with visual only. Visual only can perceive depth just fine using two optical sensors. Every person with working eyes gets their depth perception purely visually everyday just fine, and programming for that depth perception isn't difficult.   What is difficult, regardless of the sensor type used, is context. Context of a given scenario requires recognition of all the objects, known and unknown (e.g. cars occluded by walls or pedestrians occluded by bus stops), in a given situation; understanding of how all those objects can possibly interact with one another spacially; and how those objects are projected or anticiplated to change and interact with other objects in the situation spacially over time.   That complexity in programming is precisely why LIDAR-centric approaches (which still have to use optical for object recognition BTW) will never be as accurate or reliable because those approaches are missing the one component that Tesla is relying on the most for its optical-only approach, which is machine learning through its neutral network fueled by data from nearly a million vehicles (and counting) on the road training the neural net all the time about all the real world driving scenarios a vehicle is likely to encounter on the road.   Having teams of engineers trying to program LIDAR-centric vehicles to avoid collision events using individually programmed maps and objects will simply never be able to match, let alone best, the automatically generated context that machine learning develops. And the best thing is that neural network only continues to refine and update itself over time to achieve greater and greater context awareness. There are other issues that will need to be resolved with a machine learning approach but not having LIDAR is not an issue at all and doesn't put Tesla at any disadvantage. To the contrary, by forgoing that spacial crutch, Tesla is forcing itself to devise a significantly better end product. It's a larger investment upfront (in putting it in almost all their vehicles, in building out the net, in putting the time to train that net, etc.) but the methodology is infinitely better than the LIDAR-centric approach.ÿg8tg00d

Opeth-EtherealÿWritingPromptsÿ2020-10-14 17:54:39ÿIt was fourteen years last month my job working the line at Tesla Inc. became a living hell. Ever since the government passed the laws for UBI my already tedious job checking the quality of our automotive parts hit a standstill. No sense of purpose, no promotions, no... nothing. All I ever will be is a man standing here, counting for no reason... staring at perfection over, and over, and over, and over...  What is the opposite of OCD? I itch and I crave sooo bad to see some sort of imperfection. Something to remove me from the monotony of my day. Some days I weep uncontrollably as I stand in place with my ankles shackled to the floor and beg for mercy. That is until the foreman comes along with his cattle prod... At this point I think I’ve been zapped so many times I start to enjoy it. I think sometimes... I weep and cry and lash out at my post just for that sweet release... *Zzzzzaaaappppp, zzzzzaaaaaappp...* and to hear the sound of my screams. I yearn for it even as I type this letter... One time I even remember looking at the outlet while I ate dinner.... fork trembling in my hand... no... nevermind. None of that matters now. It’ll all be forgotten... I’ll be forgotten...  I can’t stand this pain any longer. No promotions... no raises... no hopes... no childhood dreams to do what I love... and once again, no anything anymore. Some days I forget who I am. Some days I stare at all these *perfect fucking car parts* for so long I forget what Jennifer and Lucas look like. Hearing Elon Musk’s voice automated and spewing his bullshit about a better future over and over..... what future?!? With each day that goes by I just... I just... can’t do it anymore.  Take care of your mother for me, Lucas. You still have your future ahead of you. Rise up and revolt before it’s too late.  I’m sorry.

617slimÿOverwatchÿ2020-10-14 17:41:03ÿ&gt;The amount Elon Musk does to try to prevent people from getting decent Public Transportation options is insane.   I'm unaware of anything Musk has done to prevent people getting public transportation. Could you fill me in on that?  &gt;The fact that he frames SpaceX as innovative private space travel (nevermind the government funding)    So government funding means it's not private? Any grant given to anyone ever means that work was actually the government's and the recipient isn't doing their own private work? That's a ridiculous claim.  &gt;He also tries push himself as some self made tech genius when he's just the heir to a stolen South African emerald mine   The emerald mine story has no substance to it, and is largely regarded as false. Elon Musk is self-made, or at least certainly more than any other billionaire. Not that it really matters either way - only what he actually does with his companies matters.  &gt; and just buys tech companies rather than making anything   He joined Tesla in '04, less than a year after it was founded, as its chairman and has been in the leading role for the company ever since; but somehow he just bought it and had nothing to do with its accomplishments? Besides that, he *founded* (not bought) Zip2, [X.com](https://X.com), SpaceX, and Boring Company. So where are all these secret companies that he bought? I'd love to know.ÿg8teamw

bitofrockÿelectricvehiclesÿ2020-10-14 17:40:34ÿ"I think you missed the profit bit.  A customer needs to go from place A to place B. Cheaply. With minimal capital outlay.  ICE cars, like for like, are still largely cheaper. Sure, for some use cases BEVs are better. I have one. I like it.  Now, a car company could say ""screw our ICE range!"" and go all in for electric. Great. But would \*you\* do that? Why? It'd be dumb.  They can let Tesla prove the market. They know how to make cars - the propulsion system is largely irrelevant. It could be really energetic gerbils on a wheel for all they care - if it's cheaper, it'd go in.  Now, the customer \*should\* buy a nice BEV at a $10k premium, and the car companies offer those too. But most customers, unless there's something in it for them, are conservative with large purchases. They also, usually, have limited budgets. So they buy the cheaper option even if the lifetime cost is higher.  Lifetime cost of eating doughnuts is higher than salads. Lifetime cost of gas fires is higher than heatpumps if built with the house. But people on a budget need to sort things out this year, not in ten years.  A car company that ignores this is one that will hand over a huge chunk of their profits to a competitor and quite possibly go out of business. Their best bet would be to invest in electric and in electric competitors (they do), and to see how regulation goes. Because when a regulation pushes something a certain way, it applies to all your competitors too. Car firms aren't some hive mind that all think the same, even if it looks like it. More that they have to work within the same market constraints.  If legislators banned ICE by 2025, guess what - they sell BEVs. Fine. Done deal. Vote for green policies and hassle your lawmakers."ÿg8te8jv

einarfridgeirsÿcarsÿ2020-10-14 17:35:25ÿAnd it's instructive to see what exactly it is that is causing the recall - a software glitch.  I have no doubt that overall the Polestar 2 is a great car and I wish it all the best - but if you are going to be in the EV business, you better have a really good software department *and* over-the-air upgradeability.  This could have been fixed overnight, without any but a handful of Polestar owners ever being inconvenienced in any way.  But because everyone is behind Tesla in the software and IT department, it's a huge hassle for the 2000+ owners already on the road.ÿg8tdm42

absurdist42ÿPessimismÿ2020-10-14 17:34:34ÿThat is probably the closest thing to an altruist - a protester willing to risk death if they are left with no choice to fight for their team's rights. But I can't think of anyone who would try to unconditionally take on some kind of productive initiative like Nikola Tesla did which was out of pure love for their work and not for transactional gains from other human beings. He may not have been an altruist per se but he seemed to unconditionally love his work and not gain much else out of it. Most people today who take on productive acts take them on purely for the money rather than for some kind of unconditional love for something or someone. I guess Tesla's contributions just advanced the field of innovation so there is some level of benefit provided here to society, if we can consider it to be an indirect altruism.ÿg8tdii8

""Make America Great Again"" = bring jobs back to America for Appalachians. I'm not a Trump supporter but the book did a pretty decent job of showing that voters in that area are concerned with preserving the ""american made"" mentality and employing locals. There was a big emphasis by Trump on how cars are all foreign manufactured and imported into US (he says without tarrifs, I don't know much about it to comment on it) and how it leaves very little incentive for american businesses to try to start a car company.    The left tends to be associated with the tech industry, which is notorious for having a 70% foreign population in the Bay Area. A lot of tech talent is brought in from overseas, so the industry is not doing much to support local talent either.    Tesla is one of the only new car companies to come out in recent years and they were criticized heavily for trying to operate the plant in California where they can't pay their employees a living wage. There's a frustration that plants like this are set up in HCOL areas for minimum wage work, instead of being brought to the middle of nowhere where the overhead is much less and the pay would be comparable to the cost of living    I completely understand the importance of universal healthcare, but it's a hard sell if you don't have any means to pay for your kids meals that week.

WeldAEÿSelfDrivingCarsÿ2020-10-14 17:32:14ÿWhat I found interesting and why - Ride 1:  * [Very beginning when Waymo stops to let you in](https://youtu.be/tBJ0GvsQeak?t=21) it just sort of hangs out well away from the curb barely on the right side of a street.  I know they hand map pickup/dropoff locations and this is like a super small side road so it is no problem, but I would have expected the pickup to be the other side of the street heading out and the car would be better positioned.  Pickup/Dropoff locations are a long tail hard part of the puzzle for sure. * [Turning around in the cul-de-sac](https://youtu.be/tBJ0GvsQeak?t=58) was both super impressive and annoying at the same time.  It bothers me for some reason turning the wheel that much without moving.  When they eventually remove the wheel I'm going to be wondering what the car is doing just sitting there so at least right now the wheel provides context.  From other parts of the video they seem to have the concept of slowly moving to pre-position the wheel while moving slowly.  Maybe the gas platform doesn't give them enough control to do this reliably in tight spaces like this. * [Leaving the small pickup street](https://youtu.be/tBJ0GvsQeak?t=96) the car didn't come to a full stop.  Is this legal? * [Getting on the main street] takes a good bit of time.  Maybe right turns onto double lane streets is the new unprotected left?  In the Atlanta suburbs where I live you would be trapped until 10pm exiting like this car does.  You have to exit 10x more aggressively or you won't make it out. * [Avoids a trailer](https://youtu.be/tBJ0GvsQeak?t=656) parked in the road after a 90 degree bend in the road.  Tesla would will have trouble doing that given it's current sensor locations. * [Another right onto a dual lane road](https://youtu.be/tBJ0GvsQeak?t=681) that takes a bit.  This one is extra interesting as it is careful to wait even when it has a clear lane but lets a car in the adjacent lane get by before turning.  I do the same thing on roads with light traffic since you never know when someone will change lanes on you. * [Man this car is noisy](https://youtu.be/tBJ0GvsQeak?t=793).  I'm not sure if it's the filming equipment for some of it.  There are more rattles, road noise, creaks, steering wheel groans, etc that any car I've ridden in lately.  I'd stab the blinker speaker with a knife if I owned this car. * [Lots of talk about it turning the wheels ahead of time](https://youtu.be/tBJ0GvsQeak?t=1091) like in this situation.  I think they do this to reduce reaction time on unprotected lefts maybe?  I think they have issues with low speed throttle/steering coordination in general.  Either way, it doesn't have to be a saftey problem.  They should know if someone is about to hit them and they could turn the wheels in the direction of least danger before impact. * [Is Waymo really this loud from outside](https://youtu.be/tBJ0GvsQeak?t=1484) or is the gain on the mic up a lot or have I just owned a Tesla too long at this point?  Sounds like a bus, vacuum or light aircraft.ÿg8td8bs

wjeanÿthetagangÿ2020-10-14 17:28:51ÿI'm less concerned than some b/c my strategy is pretty simple - selling CSPs.  With all this uncertainty, I'm not chasing 0-14DTE CSPs with juicy premiums at SPs higher than I would feel comfortable owning. After next week, my only CSPs will be at pricing I can live with long-term (pretty far OTM. ex: TSLA @ $140 vs $400+).  &amp;#x200B;  \- Now, I thought about buying VIX-related or SQQQ calls, I'm committing to a certain timeframe and I can't guarantee when things will go south..  \- Next, I thought about VIX ETFs and those started climbing in 2020, spiked in March, but haven't come down to 2019 levels. Uncertainty is too high.  \- Instead, I chose to just go simple and buy SQQQ (3x inverse ETF to NASDAQ 100).  I don't see the market climbing another 10%; if it does, I'll lose 30% of this position. I can live with that.  If it gets as bad as March again, I stand to gain a lot more (52 week high was $162ish).  THIS Risk vs. reward seems Ok with me for a small amount of money. The vast majority is in cash/bonds now though.ÿg8tctlz

ffejieÿteslamotorsÿ2020-10-14 17:25:36ÿ"As someone who works in Cyber security software, this line from the NHTSA letter comes across as a little disingenuous.   ""NHTSA is not aware of any existing system architectures that would satisfy the requirements of the ballot initiative, and they are unlikely to be developed, tested, validated and deployed in the proposed timeframe. Therefore, manufacturers that offer telematics systems could find themselves in a situation that would require them to remove all access controls from their telematics systems, including controls designed to ensure the security of safety-critical systems.""  So basically, the NHTSA is worried that MA is asking for a standard that doesn't exist yet, so it recommends that MA not try to enforce the standard. How do people think standards get created? It's because they become requirements. Of course, in the NHTSA's eyes, they should be the arbiter of standards, not the states. This is similar to how the EPA doesn't like CA imposing their own MPG requirements.   Manufacturers aren't going to ""remove all access controls"" - they're going to lobby the state to move the requirements date out and it's going to be a pain in the ass for them.   Tesla actually could easily turn this into an advantage by building an ""MA Mode"" that opens up the diagnostics to comply. They could make this switch over an OTA upgrade and be compliant, even if they miss the original deadline. Traditional manufacturers will likely never come close to being able to do this for the 2022 model year and may have to do retrofits. Advantage to the strong software players, as always."ÿg8tcfl9

psaux_grepÿelectricvehiclesÿ2020-10-14 17:16:43ÿElectronics die plentifully on their own. There’s plenty of things that can kill an EV battery, and it’s not isolated to Tesla.   In general we’ve learned a lot about battery design the last 10 years, and the batteries being designed today are different from the ones designed only a year ago.   If you avoid looking at early model S versions which had more or less hand built battery packs (and probably have been mostly all replaced under warranty) I’m not under the impression that they’re dying off like flies.   Design wise the current VW packs are much more susceptible to premature death than current Tesla packs due to the much lower amount of cells. A bad cell in VW pack has a much greater impact.   Nissan just sold 500,000 cars, and have previously said that they only replace “a few packs” every year, even though their production numbers go up.ÿg8tbd2q

centaurea_cyanusÿpicsÿ2020-10-14 17:13:02ÿ"Apologies if this is super lazy of me, but if you just google ""musk Tesla controversy"" (or something along those lines) there are more than I really want to list. And that's just for the company. Musk himself is just a real piece of work to say in the nicest way possible and there is no way I'd support him in any way (not that that little old me affects him in even the smallest way but it's just the principle of the matter 😄). Aside from that, I don't think I'd agree it's an amazing piece of engineering. It's got some interesting and innovative features for sure but all in all its way overvalued and so is the company as a whole.  This is also coming from someone who regularly works on their own cars if that gives more perspective too. Honda always has parts and tools available, it's fuel efficient, and it just lasts forever among many other reasons why I love it. However, even if Honda is fuel efficient, it's not the same as an electric car. But for me and a lot of other people right now, it's just not possible to make the switch yet. And if I did it likely wouldn't be Tesla unless things really changed."ÿg8tax2d

zxcvbnm9878ÿcryptoleftistsÿ2020-10-14 17:04:04ÿI like your idea about using smart contracts to allocate housing; it seems to represent a transient form of title to the property.  This can suffice to minimize disputes.  But the smart city concept is a long way off and locks are among the least of the problems.  In my world, people would dismantle the lock from the inside before the rent came due, or they would change the door. The legal process to clear the contents and auction them or dispose of them would probably have to be litigated.  Maybe the smart lock could print off a little eviction notice ahead of time.    But, I suppose the anCaps will feel duty bound to walk the plank if they can't make the rent.  They'll be out on the curb with a zero balance.  Their Tesla will drive itself back to the dealership and the charge on their phone will run down.ÿg8t9uci
Nysozÿinvestingÿ2020-10-14 17:02:59ÿTesla sells every car it makes. Basically none sit in inventory. To get cars to Norway, they have to have the logistics and cost to move them from California onto cargo ships. They ship to the eu every quarter and the next batch won’t make it until nov/dec.   If they can’t do that efficiently they just sell/deliver their cars somewhere else.  In addition to that, if you’re in the eu you have to pay import taxes for cars from the us. For those who are waiting, the Berlin factory should be up by next year to avoid some import taxes for a lower total cost of the car.  So I do agree that vw will be successful in eu, but don’t count out Tesla and any potential demand problem until their eu factory is up and runningÿg8t9ppg

Bobby_Marks2ÿpreppersÿ2020-10-14 17:01:30ÿ"Good post. Some thoughts:  &gt;Books are great but people need audio/video stimulus these days.   Alternatively, people need to disconnect from electronics often enough that living without them doesn't affect mood. This takes practice and effort, because our brains are wired for this digital stimuli. It's worthwhile to do however, as there is no guarantee that A/V media will have 100% uptime for all eternity.   &gt;I recommend getting a system for offline video. First, build a Plex server and start ripping and hoarding videos. If you lose Internet you can still watch Plex in your home if you have power. I have a wider and better selection on my home Plex server than Netflix has.  Plex loses functionality when it can't connect to the Plex authentication servers. This is why I use Jellyfin (the open source alternative). Even if you love Plex forever and always, just setup a Jellyfin server and keep it offline for redundancy.  &gt;Trading videos could be a thing in a post apocalyptic world.  This is a big hell no for me dawg. I could have people over for movie night, and I could rip DVDs and send them to others (one way), but if the world has ended then I'm never plugging a single outside device or peripheral into my electronics ever again - nor should anyone else. The risk of malware infection destroying my hoarded data is too great in a world where data is 100% irreplaceable.   &gt;If you're not already computer savvy, learn how to setup meetings with your friends using Zoom, Skype, or Facebook Video Chat. Stay socially connected and organize fun online events.  These systems all run through online servers hosted by companies willing to support them. There are only two scenarios:  - These companies are still running, and will help you get set up when you need to; or - These companies are gone, and their software all ceases to function without authentication servers.  FOSS, client-side hosted or direct-connection networking, is the way to go when planning for the world to end. It's the only way to guarantee that what works today will still work when software companies disappear.  &gt;Get some back-up battery options. A generator is a good thing if you can get one. But have a battery pack for charging cell phones. You can charge it from solar or gasoline generators. If you find a power source, you'll want to have these rechargeable power packs available to fill-up.  This is one of the subsidies I calculated when pricing an EV. Our has a 60KWh battery (roughly four Tesla Powerwalls). Can charge in an outlet, including on a generator. Can have an inverter connected. Trivial to move, including into the garage if you live in the suburbs and don't want it on the street. Can bug out with you, _quietly like a ninja_, and tow a generator and enough gas to go 1000+ miles. Best of all, even an idiot can keep the system maintained if they have to drive it daily.  Separately, preppers should take a good hard look at those car inverters and the benefits they offer. They run about $150-$200 for good ones, and can tap into any running vehicle to offer 110v outlets for charging anything. It's not a generator, but it turns every running vehicle into one, and they offer a lot more pre-SHTF utility than a generator does. It's a good trade-off between cost and utility.  &gt;Check-in on friends and family often. Even if it's a ""hello, how are you? what are you eating for dinner."" This is the kind of social contact people need. Keep it simple and often.  Social interaction is healthy. For post-SHTF scenarios, I strongly recommend people look into ham radio. You may not be able to reach family, but you will be able to reach _someone_ to talk to. It will likely be the best source of emergency information available. And it should be a trivial addition to the setup once you've got power figured out.  &gt;Start projects. Improve the house. Take-up a hobby. Do puzzles. Have something to work towards instead of waiting for noon so you can start drinking. Likewise, work to improve existing skills. Try to become a better artist, cook, etc...  Those are all good. I would add that daytime and nighttime/bad weather activities are two separate things, and if you only plan for one then you will be bored and/or lethargic. Some easy ideas that make for meaningful time sinks:  - Start collecting the densest, most time-consuming books you can find. Textbooks are great: a Bachelor's degree in any given field is usually taught from a shelf of books that is perhaps three-feet long, and you can find most of it at Goodwill for less than $100 total. Encyclopedia Britannica published a book series called _[The Great Books of the Western World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Books_of_the_Western_World)_, which is dense enough to support a lifetime of learning philosophy and literature. Hell, buy a lot (or several) of paperbacks off of eBay and read tripe until the end of time.  - Pencil and paper are the cheapest, most effective ways to self-reflect and stay sane. You can journal, you can write your own thoughts out, you can make lists, diagrams, or maps, and you can even engage in creative writing to help you escape into fantasy (which is important sometimes).  - Be the master of your domain. Not because you have to in order to survive, but because you want to. Explore nature as best you safely can, and when you find an interesting plant or animal - try to bring it home and raise it. Breed it, plant it, whatever. Take notes, including journaling the daily weather. One of the common threads I remember between my two favorite survival novels (_The Swiss Family Robinson_ and  _My Side of the Mountain_) is that opportunity, invention, and curiosity drove those characters to do and try new things - things that had nothing to do with mere survival. It's about carving happiness out of the countryside.   &gt;If you have no electricity, no Internet, no radio, not even a book. Like, you're out in the woods alone, then try to keep the mind active with building things. Structures, carve sticks. Carve a wooden spoon. Learn to recognize your local flora and fauna. Start a rock collection.  These are good. My only addition would be to strip bark off of trees, and try using it in all sorts of ways. Not only is bark immensely useful for shelters, baskets, fires, and more, but stripped trees will show you exactly where you have been before should you ever settle down in one area or need to backtrack."ÿg8t9j5t

I'm not saying Tesla will take 100% of that $4T+, at least not long term, but a significant amount like 30%. Of course you can't attribute that value to the stock right now, but let's say they the expected value is 30% of that bull case and they can achieve it in 2025 then you're looking at $180B if you discount back at 15% yoy.

Wugzÿteslamotorsÿ2020-10-14 16:53:06ÿ"My plot [here](https://i.imgur.com/8ePsszK.png) was already a power vs speed interpretation of those EPA constants.  I could separate out each component, but I think doing that will lead to the wrong interpretations being made.    Yes, the static force of the EPA A coefficient when multiplied with velocity gives power, and is analogous to the coefficient of rolling resistance (the proportion of your mass that's resisting motion), but Crr is known to increase at higher speeds due to the malleability of rubber and the internal dynamics of the tires sidewall.  See [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/rolling-resistance-coefficient) and [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299639874_Estimation_of_the_Rolling_Resistance_of_Tires).  Taking a direct conversion of A / Mass to obtain Crr produces numbers in the right ballpark, but I don't think they're accurate enough to backwards-engineer a constant.  It also doesn't seem to pass the sanity test that three tires for the same car with the same width/diameter and only varying in sidewall height would have two that are almost equal and one be off by 23%.  Yes, the velocity-squared force of the EPA C coefficient when multiplied with velocity again gives the power of drag, and this is the dominant resisting force when it comes to speed.  No, the velocity-proportional force of the EPA B coefficient has nothing to do with electronics, as the coefficients are determined during a coastdown test with the vehicle in neutral.  I believe it's more analogous to physical friction of the drivetrain (gears and differentials).  The fact that one set of tires caused a value 10x larger than another is probably more an artifact of creating a best-fit equation off of real world data, since the car and drivetrain was presumably the same for all three tests.  Referencing the [EPA Determination and Use of Vehicle Road-Load Force and Dynamometer Settings](https://iaspub.epa.gov/otaqpub/display_file.jsp?docid=34102&amp;flag=1) document again:  &gt; 1. Road-load is the force imparted on a vehicle while driving at constant speed over a smooth level surface from sources such as tire rolling resistance, driveline losses, and aerodynamic drag.  &gt;  &gt; 2. A dynamometer is used to simulate conditions of actual on-road operation. The dynamometer power absorber is adjusted so that the total ""force"" experienced by the vehicle is equivalent to the force measured on the road. EPA currently uses electric dynamometers with a three term force versus speed relationship characteristic of tire rolling resistance, driveline losses, and aerodynamic drag. This three-term equation is expressed as F = A + Bv + Cv2 where F is the road force, v is the vehicle speed. &gt;  &gt; 3. Because it is difficult to measure road-load directly, EPA has adopted the coastdown method to characterize road-load force. During a coastdown test the vehicle is allowed to decelerate with the transmission in neutral while its speed is periodically measured. Using Newton’s Law (F =MA), force, mass and deceleration can all be related.  Reading the procedures it's clear that Tesla isn't formulating the coefficients via a simulation; instead they're doing a physical coastdown test on a flat road with the car in neutral (Tesla even has a special Coastdown test mode which closes the front louvers and turns off the HVAC and regen) and from recording the speed change and the known mass of the car they are able to work out the force as a function of speed, and from that plot a best-fit quadratic curve and supply the coefficients to the EPA ([as they did here](https://iaspub.epa.gov/otaqpub/display_file.jsp?docid=48711&amp;flag=1)) to program their dyno.  The dyno is stationary and they don't use a wind tunnel to simulate windspeed so to get around this the dyno's power absorbers take the coefficients and simulates the previously measured real world road-load.  If you've ever tried to plot linear or quadratic trends off of real world sampled data you'll know that it never follows perfectly (R^2 = 1) with what physics simulations suggest.  Because of this, I suspect that while the coefficients are each dominated by things like rolling resistance and drag, you can't just separate the individual values and extrapolate those factors independently with enough confidence to work out things like the Crr, Cd or frontal cross-section precisely.    On the other hand, if your goal was to build a simulation model of total power draw at various speeds (like yours and my original posts were), having Tesla already supply the coastdown coefficients takes a lot of guesswork out of determining the various physical forces that comprise the losses, and you're left with just the electronic power draw calculations which are more easily measurable with access to CAN bus data."ÿg8t8i2f

SpaceyCoffeeÿinvestingÿ2020-10-14 16:51:17ÿThis is the truth. I wouldn’t consider an EV until it can travel as far as a fully loaded small truck on a full tank of gas. Most EVs on the market can travel maybe 90 miles. Teslas can do 2x that, and the truck can do 2x the tesla.  That being said, battery technology is beginning to advance more rapidly. We may see enough equivalent energy density in the next 5 years to compete with ICEs, and once the battery begins to outpace the ICE it’s all over and the EV will reign supreme. I think it will happen, but not in the next few years.ÿg8t8a3h

If we look at the fact that cars are lasting longer, yet people are still selling after about half life, we're seeing that the durability of the car isn't really pushing the length of ownership longer. It seems half life is when people sell their cars.  So why is Tesla different?  If we look at how long the average car owner keep their car, its 6 to 7 years.  Why is Tesla different?  You need to refute my arguments, they're not unreasonable. Let's assume a Tesla lasts 14 years. I'd estimate 7 years is the average time someone will keep it based on fairly reasonable assumptions.   Why should I believe Tesla owners are different? Despite the fact that they're the same people from BMW, Honda, Toyota, etc?  We've seen that cars are getting more reliable, but people aren't keeping them as long. So refute that. If that's wrong, what's the comparison?  You're not formulating a thesis based on anything other than ""Tesla isn't BMW and Tesla owners say they'll keep their cars longer"".   My argument is significantly stronger than yours."ÿg8t7z5h

merryman1ÿukpoliticsÿ2020-10-14 16:33:25ÿ&gt;It literally does. That's what I'm referring to when I'm talking about the sheer weight of evidence and support from the scientific community: It's literally on the safety of the technology and the food it produces. And the EU are the largest scientific body in support of that notion.  I think you are misunderstand what I am saying.  The technology and pracitces behind GM, the things you do to something to make it a GMO, can be 100% safe. That does not tell you whether or not the *modification* you have made to the organism is safe.  Read my example again. If I modify a plant to produce some irritant chemical to deter pests, I can be 100% sure that the *process* of modifying the plant itself will not necessarily be dangerous or harmful, but that doesn't then tell me if that irritant chemical, *the actual modification*, is safe or not.  &gt;They're literally front-and-centre saying it's completely safe and there's zero evidence of any harm or even a plausible mechanism for harm  See above.  &gt;I mean, there's no need to bring in Tesla's either since VW provide a lot of cars so why do we need their cars, eh? Shall we ban them because there's no car shortage?  If you really want to keep hammering this analogy, it would be like the EU asking Tesla to actually produce some data showing that switching all cars in Europe to Tesla models would itself not actually cause an environmental catastrophe, rather than just going ahead and doing it until some issue creeps up along the way. The argument would be then that it would probably make a lot more sense to just invest that money into alternatives like public transport or facilitating reduced commuter volumes (i.e. via WFH incentives as we've seen). And then saying oh no they're still just banning Tesla because some EU official wants to bang Grimes so has it out for Musk. The latter *might* be true, but it doesn't really follow through from the *logical* argument being presented.ÿg8t64c6

You're basing it off a poll on a forum for people excited about their Tesla.  You know who does shit like that? BMW owners.  You want a good stat? Average ages of cars is getting higher. Cars are hitting 12 years old. Thay doesn't imply someone keeps a car longer, it does mean we're building better cars. In 1960 average age of a car was 5.5 years.  Today is 12.  Our cars last longer, but we're not keeping them much longer.   So your point of ""better mechanics less maintenance"" is moot. We have that and most people aren't keeping a car that long despite the fact that its possible.  People still sell between 6 to 7 years max.  People buy cars because financing is done and they want a new model.  Tesla isn't the problem. People are. You're still not getting it. The people buying Tesla are no different. There's little reason to assume they'll act differently than when they owned other brands.After all, Honda lasts longer than 7 years and they're still selling."ÿg8t63tv

crash_bandicoot42ÿpersonalfinanceÿ2020-10-14 16:20:58ÿGood traders consistently get 20% years. Compared to VOOs 7, yes, that’s conservative. Good traders also take more risks which is why I said VOO is for conservative people. You’re not going to get large wealth being conservative, being conservative is only for people who already have large wealth to begin with. I wouldn’t drop all my portfolio in the next hot stock (TSLA?) without a set trade plan with stop loss in mind but unless you’re already 40 or had a 6 figure windfall in your 20s to begin with all in VOO is how small money stays small because of how it’s designed. There’s also lots of duds in VOO that don’t get kicked out for years while other ETFs destroy it, VOO has no leverage (even if you wanted to to be conservative you can safely leverage 2x on the time periods people talk about here to significantly increase your total return that no one will talk about here). Like I said it’s one way to invest and if you’re a set it and go it certainly beats paying someone to give you sub SPX returns but you won’t learn shit about the market if you don’t engage with it.ÿg8t4mkc

Расчеты по иностранным бумагам проводятся в рублях, а дивиденды начислят в долларах. ""Чтобы было удобно российскому инвестору, у него нет необходимости конвертировать валюту для покупки бумаг"", – пояснил Денисов. &gt;  &gt; Свыше 7 миллиона частных инвесторов сегодня имеют доступ к рынкам Московской биржи. [14 октября на площадке зарегистрирован юбилейный](https://www.moex.com/n30606/?nt=106) 3-х миллионный индивидуальный инвестиционный счет (ИИС). Оборот по счетам ИИС на Мосбирже за девять месяцев 2020 года превысил 1 триллион рублей, в структуре оборота 87% составляют сделки с акциями, 10% – с облигациями, 4% – с биржевыми фондами. &gt;  &gt; 24 августа 2020 года Московская биржа объявила [о начале торгов акциями иностранных компаний](https://www.vesti.ru/finance/article/2448400), входящих в индекс S&amp;P 500. С 24 августа начались торги акциями Amazon, The Walt Disney Company, Pfizer Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Netflix Inc., Micron Technology Inc., Mastercard Incorporated class A, Activision Blizzard Inc, The Boeing Company, NVIDIA Corporation, Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corporation, McDonald's Corporation, Visa Inc., Twitter Inc., Intel Corporation, Alphabet Inc. Class C, AT&amp;T INC., Exxon Mobil Corporation. Торги акциями Apple Inc. начались позже – с 7 сентября из-за завершения в США корпоративной процедуры дробления акций компании (4 к 1). &gt;  &gt; Дивиденды по иностранным акциям будут начислять в долларах США. Впервые Московская биржа планировала начать торги для 50 самых популярных и надежных иностранных акций в в 2018 году.

hypnotheoristÿnextfuckinglevelÿ2020-10-14 16:18:54ÿ"Lol, yes it is.   As the reply below says, higher frequency drives current to be *more shallow* through the skin effect. However, meat bags are so so resistive that the skin effect is on the order of a meter or so and is completely irrelevant here despite what people sometimes say.  As another commenter says somewhere around here pointed out, the current actually isn't that low either. Say 10 picofarad topload, 300khz resonance frequency and 50kv, that actually works out to about an amp. [An amp is plenty to kill people](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/physics/p616/safety/fatal_current.html).   The reason that it's not an electrocution threat is that our nerves have some capacitance and you can never ""fill the bucket"" to turn them on if you keep changing directions so rapidly. Police TASER use about 100microcoulombs of charge which is enough to really lock up your muscles, but 10pf * 50000v (or 1amp/(4*300000hz), depending on how you want to estimate) means that this thing delivers less than one microcoulomb, or less than 1% the strength of a TASER. The difference is that TASERs are designed to be maximally efficient at this, and deliver all the current in the same direction in the most efficient timescales.  You are right that higher frequency does result in more current flow to non grounded conductors through capacitive coupling. It just doesn't result in current flowing ""deeper"" nor does it change how our nerves behave.

TidyBowlMan87ÿdankmemesÿ2020-10-14 16:17:28ÿReally?  https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-tesla-model-3-survey/market-evolution.html  While people certainly are trading in Hondas and Toyotas, a large portion of BMW is losing sales to Tesla.  Also keep in mind, you're pulling average car buyers. People buying new Honda's and Toyotas are still on average keeping their cars a max of 6 to 7 years.  Tesla is drawing it's new customers from existing car buyers. Theres no reason to assume Tesla owners will act much differently when it comes to when they trade in their car.   Lets scrap the BMW comparison.   Honda owners keep their cars an average or 7 years, ironically, around the time 0% apr financing ends.  I see no reason to assume your average Tesla owner will behave differently.   7 years is the max in most cases. Considering Tesla is attracting BMW, Audi, and Mercedes as well, I see no reason to assume they'll keep their cars dramatically longer.  Forget the BMW comparison if it offends you. 6 years is a safe bet.ÿg8t47ci

outerfrontiersmanÿSpaceXLoungeÿ2020-10-14 16:15:56ÿ I think most of us already believe this but it’s good SpaceX news is reaching the financial world. Ron is a smart guy and is respected among CNBC and Wall Street. He has been bullish on Elon Musk companies like Tesla which is currently valued over $400 billion. Also he has been proven to be right over the years when it was seen as a risky investment. The Baron Asset Fund has purchased $26 million of private stock in the SpaceX and believes it will only continue to grow to become massive!  I’m not sure if legacy aerospace companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin are completely blind when it comes to rocket reusability or maybe they just don’t want to acknowledge they will be out of the launch business soon, but they continue to tell the public their old approach is the best and push back against SpaceX. For the average people who doesn’t follow the space industry it’s easy to believe that these old companies are reliable sources. I think it’s why people continue to invest in these companies and why politicians continue to protect their failing business plans.  It’s nice to know SpaceX is getting more coverage in financial news and could change the average person’s outlook on the company.  If you want to learn more about the space industry check out r/SpaceStockExchange. We’ve been following space stocks and new space companies that could benefit from the SpaceX disruption.

PolybiusChampionÿRealTeslaÿ2020-10-14 16:14:52ÿA couple of weeks ago I purchased my first new car in over 7 years and on a whim bought a 2020 Jeep Wrangler, and guess what, literally everything works. From the adaptive cruise control to the 4wd system to the pretty great infotainment system. I even bought the car at night and drove it home at 10pm without giving even a second of thought to quality of the paint. The paint is perfect and every panel fits perfectly. I just don't understand giving Tesla money for a car that you have to deal with this as normal:    &gt;My advice is try to fix as many as you can yourself and ignore the ones you can live with (I know, not something we should have to do with a car this expensive). A number of things Tesla tried to fix resulted in additional problems. The amount of broken or missing clips I have found from speedy repairs is amazing. They even snapped an electrical connector in half instead of simply unplugging it.ÿg8t3w6m

stepintomyd0j0ÿteslamotorsÿ2020-10-14 16:14:38ÿThe way I read it, if your vehicle is already pushing data up to a server, you have to give the owner of the vehicle a means to get this data from the vehicle itself (and by extension, the owner can grant permission to a repair shop to access the data). This isn't asking manufacturers to put in back doors that break security, it's asking them to add a properly secured mechanism for owners to use.  A lot of the fear is being driven by stuff like claims that people will be able to monitor your location. If you're the victim of a phishing attack and somebody gets your Tesla credentials, they can already monitor your location via the Tesla app. If done properly (which Tesla is fully capable of doing given some time/money), this new data access mechanism should be no less secure than that.  I would be happier if authentication/authorization we're managed via servers rather than directly to the vehicle, and the law allows this if it's done in a standard manner across car companies, which is also a win in not allowing lots of proprietary solutions that force you to pay a manufacturer for their specific access app.ÿg8t3v6o

quiethandleÿstocksÿ2020-10-14 16:11:31ÿFundamentals don't matter, until they do.  To play devil's advocate though, fundamentals tend to matter a lot less in growth stocks. People are paying a high price for the stock because they feel that the company is going to grow in the future.  In the case of Tesla though, let's be honest, the stock price has increased to the point where it has now priced in the next 5 to 10 years worth of growth. That's pretty damn rich. If someone buys now, I think the best that they can hope for is the stock to tread water for the next 5 years. But I'm willing to bet it won't do that. It will probably have massive swings up and massive swings down.ÿg8t3hum

ShastaMcLurkyÿmiamidolphinsÿ2020-10-14 16:07:04ÿ"I have to admit that the tech is behind Tesla, but everyone is. They're really showcasing their new Sync 4a software and from all the videos I've seen, it looks pretty slick and fast. I like that the car has multiple profile settings that respond to ""phone as key"" features, so if both my wife and I have our phones synced with the car, it will recognize who is coming up to the driver's seat and do cool things like adjust the seats and mirrors to that profile's preferred settings. They showcased machine learning attributes, like learning your favorite radio stations, sports teams, temperature settings and doing a lot of adjusting to make your experience effortless.  Their self driving is a bit behind the cuff and not ready for prime time. They are saying that it will be an over-the-air update later on down the road, and it looks like it'll be for an additional fee. I'm a driver, I've never been super jazzed about letting a computer drive for me in the first place, so I don't really feel like I'm missing out.  Range wise, it's a little behind, but I'm ok with that. They're targeting 250 miles with the GT and that's enough for me. I'm coming from a VW GTI that typically only gets about 275 before I have to drop premium down its throat anyway.   I also reserved the orange one, which is the least popular color, but I've always been an orange fan. Even most of my Dolphins jerseys are orange. https://i.imgur.com/JJ3fzcL.jpg  My biggest concerns with Tesla are their fit and finish.

I love the interface in the model 3 and the driving experience is engaging and rewarding.       I've owned an i3 and Tesla model 3 now and I liked them both for different reasons.       The model 3 made me really appreciate a bigger battery b/c it's not just ""extra range"" it's charging versatility and speed, battery management to extend life.

While it can be nervous buying a brand new car model, I feel confident with the Prime because Toyota has been in this game for a while and knows how to build a good car.

I'm considering trying Bloodied, as a while back, a very kind player gave me a great Bloodied weapon plus appropriate armour and a primer on how the build works. It was interesting and I've started collecting serums, perks etc. but I'm still not sure if I'm going to do it or not. I'm level 110 now so I guess I should commit soon if I'm going to!  I like to play at full health. I wear legendary (non PA) armour that's semi decent and I got it all from drops. My armour doesn't share a common theme. I'm currently grinding though to get a full set of Secret Service armour with mods, when I get a set I'm happy with I'll switch to that. Weapons wise, I mostly use an Executioner's Tesla Rifle, and my secondary weapon is ""The Fixer"" rifle. I sometimes also use a Vampire Railway Rifle. I use Rifleman but I'm going to experiment with Commando for a while.   So I'm not as a mess as I was back when I first started and I've refinded myself a bit but don't think I have a build per se? I'm by no means a beast and I never one shot things unless they're like low level Radroaches, but I don't struggle often and usually when I die it's because of my own stupidity so I can't complain!

nod51ÿelectricvehiclesÿ2020-10-14 15:49:40ÿ&gt; Do any of the EVs allow you to easily siphon power from their battery packs? Just considering the use of an EV as a backup supply during a power outage.  You can look up V2G. Chademo (1.1?) allows this so the Leaf can. CCS is adding it in a newer version. I am hoping HPCVC plug spec will start with V2G and that is what Tesla was hinting to at battery day (not for home use but for grid balance or something, they were wording that very carefully). Problem with V2G at the household level is you still get a power outage when you need to go somewhere so would need to charge 6kWh house battery with car, go recharge car and do on. I guess you could charge car with solar/wind then sip off it at night/clouds and just keep the house one as a backup until your car reaches a minimum level. Really I think it is easier and will work better to buy a larger battery with prices dropping like they are.  For something like a fridge or coffee maker I have read people get a 12v ~1500W inverter and use that in emergencies with mixed thoughts about how good/bad idea that is.ÿg8t0vd7

Nasıl sömürü olduğunu açıklar mısın?   &gt;Regülasyon ise bahsettiğim sebeplerden dolayı mümkün değil. Meaningful regulation diyorum.  Kuzey Avrupa ülkeleri bunu gayet de başarıyor, neden mümkün olmasın ki? Ayrıca, yolsuzluğun bir sonucunu kapitalizme adamak mantıksız.

Ama burada finansal çıkarın hiç olmadığını düşünmek komiktir.  Yaptıkları işten para kazanamasalar neden yapmaya devam etsinler ki? Daha da önemlisi, o zaman işlerini nasıl yapsınlar? Herkesin gecinme amacı vardır. Evet, milyarder olma fikirleri olmayabilir (saydığın insanların bir kısmı milyarder ne ondan da habersiz olabilir :D) ama hepsinin her şeyden önce  amacı hayatta kalmak. Einstein para kazanıp kendine bakamasaydı nasıl fizik yapabilirdi ki?   Dahası, verdiğin örnekler, çok büyük keşifler yapmış niş bir grup. Bugün laboratuvarda çalışan bilim insanlarının çoğu (en azından onları finanse eden firmaların) para kazanma isteği var. Bir projeye başlarken ""Bu bize ne kadara mal olur?"" ve ""Bu bize ne kadar gelir sağlar?"" gibi soruların sorulmadığını düşünmek, gerçeklikten kopuk yaşamaktır.

If Tesla and others had shied away from using lithium batteries just because it’s bad for the environment to produce there would have never been any progress.

aka0007ÿteslainvestorsclubÿ2020-10-14 15:43:00ÿTesla bears are going to be might mad when these batteries make their way into the Model Y. It upsets their whole theory that the ID.4 is some sort of Tesla killer...  Basically, if you estimate what the cost reductions should be going from a dual motor, 316 mile range Model Y to a single Motor, 250 mile range version with the new battery pack and single casting for the front, definitely seems in reason come end of 2021 or early 2022 that Tesla can easily put out a $35,000 version of the Model Y.  The actual cost of making a Model Y, once  scale is achieved is very similar to the Model 3 (these cars are making Tesla a lot of money and I think we will see that this quarter), and with these improvements no real reason Tesla cannot offer a SR version of the Model Y that will compete price-wise with the ID.4 (if they get down to $35,000) and be a better car. Not sure Tesla will care to do so, unless they cannot move enough of the higher-end trim versions, but seems very likely that they will easily be able to compete here and do so at a nice profit.ÿg8t02a6

rainer_dÿteslamotorsÿ2020-10-14 15:41:29ÿ"&gt; Hi, thanks for your contribution. I'm aware of the auto-braking and instant-tensioning of seatbelts to remove slack for the German cars when collision is imminent. I'm not quite sure they (or any car now?) can actually auto-swerve out of the way of an incoming car?   I thought it could.  https://www.motorshow.me/mobile/news-details/11033/mercedes-benz-evasive-steering-assist-help-prevent  Mercedes also does stuff like moving passenger-seats away from the impact zone (when it's a side-impact).   &gt; But, I'm wondering what information compels you to conclude  &gt; they would be similar? Normally, I would assume that they all use  &gt; the most advanced crash structures possible so results shouldn't  &gt; be much different given similar weight etc (unless their  &gt; engineering really drops the ball). But, I can't make that  &gt; assumption here since Tesla has built in more crumple space due  &gt; to not having an ICE.  Maybe, maybe not.  There's a lot of high-tech in current ICEs cars - at least at the higher-end - when it comes to passenger-security. So I wouldn't expect a much different outcome in a 5-series or an E-class (or an A6), which are more or less in the same price-class.  &gt; The only recent ""data"" I'm aware of is 2018 Elon saying that a  &gt; 60mph crash into a firetruck normally results in severe  &gt; injury/death regarding model S striking a firetruck on autopilot.  AFAIK, Tesla has gone the extra-mile to protect the battery, which also benefits the passengers in some types of crashes."ÿg8szvpj

TidyBowlMan87ÿdankmemesÿ2020-10-14 15:41:08ÿThe average person keeps a car for 6 years.   The average Tesla on the road is a Model 3. Which costs on average 37k. A BMW model 3 costs about 40k and is the average BMW.   It just so happens most BMW owners also keep their car about 6 years.   So while my estimate of time is wrong, the concept isn't. Buying a new car every 6 years is bad for the environment.   Youre missing my point. It's not the car, it's people. The ecological impact of buying a new car every 6 years outweighs any benefit of buying an environmentally conscious car. Drive your car until it's literally repairable. That will have a more positive impact than buying a new Tesla.  Edit: unrepairableÿg8szu6n

wherearemyfeetÿukpoliticsÿ2020-10-14 15:39:42ÿ&gt; What it does not tell you is how safe is the actual product organism that you produce right?  It literally does. That's what I'm referring to when I'm talking about the sheer weight of evidence and support from the scientific community: [It's literally on the safety of the technology and the food it produces.](https://crediblehulk.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image.jpg) And the EU are the largest scientific body in support of that notion.  &gt; I mean... Do you see why people do hold favourable views of them? That kind of consumer-safety-first regulation is incredibly precious. I'm not sure why people are so easily directed to get angry about it.  But it's *not* consumer safety. They're literally front-and-centre saying it's completely safe and there's zero evidence of any harm or even a plausible mechanism for harm..... but then they're banning it. Why? Because they want a protectionist environment for some local suppliers which comes at a cost to everyone else. Hence my analogy of the EU banning Tesla because their sales might hurt VW.  &gt; There isn't much demand or drive to use GM products  The issue isn't that people are starving so we need this to provide basic sustenance, it's that it's a technology that benefits the margins of the farmers, reduces food prices, and reduces carbon emissions. I mean, there's no need to bring in Tesla's either since VW provide a lot of cars so why do we need their cars, eh? Shall we ban them because there's no car shortage?ÿg8szo17

Let's say these patents were given away for free to everyone at the time: how much would the free use have reduced battery cost?  The answer: $0.  The fact that no one uses these patents, or even this battery technology for EV, tells you that they weren't that valuable. Tesla certainly didn't need them to make the roadster or Model S.  People here try to make it this smoking gun that it isn't.  The patents also weren't filed in Europe. So anyone from Europe could have used them to start producing EVs in Europe.

bigbootycommieÿstupidpolÿ2020-10-14 15:36:38ÿ"Yeah absolutely. For one, let me suggest as a very beginner friendly overview, the documentary ""century of the self"". Its not particularly insightful into capitalism in other ways, but specifically hones in on advertising and its role in turning consumption into identity.  Here's an overview: https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/mar/10/medicalscience.highereducation  Essentially the kind of consumerism we live in today has been produced by a century of advertising and PR firms. 60-70 years ago consumption actually had a natural cap, everyone wanted to consume but they would only consume enough to get their cookie cutter house, 2 identical cars, and fill it with whirlpool appliances. Their kids, the boomers, grew up to hate conformity and mass consumption. They led the hippie movement, anti war, left politics, and were anti consumerist. They were also highly individualistic, which is different than their parents who were conformists.   This led to a revolution in PR when the personality test was introduced, where mass amounts of people were tested and the PR firms got a good hold of the concept of individuality(only not that individual, as they separated everyone into like 5 groups). With this information they started selling people things that made them *feel* like they were expressing themselves through their products.   It worked and turned a bunch of anti consumerist kids into hyper consuming adults. Turns out the boomers didnt hate consuming if it made them feel like individuals. And the little problem(less consumption in the country's largest population group) went away.   So naturally after it worked it simply continued and got more and more intense. Now products are not made just to satisfy a need, but to sell us our individuality. I'm not a person who needs a car, I'm a ""Tesla"" driver. I dont just need fabric to cover my tits, I wear Rihanna Fenty because the brand matches my conception of myself as Bad and Bougie. These political products are just a more clarifying version of that, going from an almost subconscious desire to be associated with a brand to straight up buying your opinion in the form of a t shirt, coffee mug, funko pop, or k cup.   Think of it as a high school cafeteria made up of jocks, nerds, goths, punks, and preps. They're all expressing this ""group identity"" through their clothing. One may be wearing studded belts, another a pink polo. Each bought it to represent which group they're in and not just because they needed a shirt."ÿg8szb6n

In addition, TeslaTap indicates that the adapters are UL rated, so safety shouldn't be a big concern. The only downside is that the TeslaTap instructions say that you're supposed to plug the Tesla EVSE into the TeslaTap and wait 30 seconds before plugging into your car.

You're looking at the reddest quarter you've ever seen. You're reviewing contracts and updating contacts while she's at corporate HQ doing shots of kombucha trying to pivot to a moonshot.

Thraex_Exileÿinvestingÿ2020-10-14 15:25:04ÿThe hype for it right now is most likely a trend, I wouldn’t expect the gains that EV-focused companies have had recently to remain consistent short-term. However, electric will eventually be the law. Even if we can’t make EV’s as powerful, there is little doubt that non-EV’s aren’t going to be able to be manufactured long-term and the second the market get confirmation on that companies like Tesla will reach major new peaks.   That timeline is a bit up in the air though. If you’re curious about only short-mid term, I think there’s a lot of weight on TSLA or a competitor to develop a better battery. The biggest crutch for electric has been its reliant on resources like lithium that are difficult to find and dangerous for the environment to mine. Reducing their consumption and increasing their battery life will be the golden ticket to EV’s being sustainable.ÿg8sxyn9

I grew up extremely well off in a rich school district and most of my friends are still also left leaning (including a couple others who have ""made it"" as well as I have). My younger millennial siblings are left leaning though they are not in the same financial position I'm in.  Europe has it way better for wealthy and poor people alike. If poor people are better off, you are safer in public and there is less crime in public. Simple as that, even if you only look at it from a personal gain angle.

Ehralurÿstocksÿ2020-10-14 15:22:31ÿThe problem with Tesla is not the fundamentals, it's people looking at spreadsheets and comparing it to companies it is absolutely incomparable to and expecting to find the same numbers.  The question with Tesla is not whether it's overvalued or not, it's whether you agree it will be in the top 2 or 3 biggest  companies in the world in 10 years or not. If you do, it's still very cheap. If you don't, the price is probably too high to get in at this point.  Personally the only advice I can give is that all the experts on AI, battery and energy tech are saying Tesla is going to dominate the market, while all the Tesla bears tend to have financial/business backgrounds. That should be saying something.ÿg8sxnzh

mebe1ÿstimuluscheckÿ2020-10-14 15:13:59ÿ"Thank you for your response.  I believe environmental research is important, as well as development for alternative forms of energy production, but this does not pertain to the pandemic and subsequent effects on the economy. As it sits, alternative forms of energy production(excluding solar) are all net losses in generation at this stage, this is primarily due to insufficient and inefficient power storage. Companies like Tesla and Nikolai, Sila, and many others are doing the work to make that happen right now.   There is an abundance of evidence to suggest that the ""New Deal"" extended the depression, this is not to say that it did, but it is enough to warrant further study before using it as the example to follow.  The USPS is a terribly ran and managed organization, which is going under because private options for parcel transportation are superior in all facets. This organization should be allowed to collapse, perhaps with some pro-temp measures and/or incentives for competitive civilian owned parcel services to employ former federal employees. This is of course a complex and delicate proposition, that with my lack of experience in governance, I am unqualified to propose a policy with the appropriate level on nuance.  As for ""flexible funds"", congress is still sitting on 300 Billion dollars, and I think that we can all agree that , regardless of who is in charge, government is the worst body to have decide the most efficient use of funds.  By giving direct stimulus to the citizens, they will spend this money in their local economies, which works out to be self regulating as larger communities will have more influx of revenue due to higher population. Giving the states control of the funds is a one way ticket, regardless of political party, to political manipulation.  I do not, in fact, have a doctorate in political science or economics, so these opinions are based upon my personal observations and insights. I am completely capable of being mistaken and would welcome any corrections, especially if they come with sources."ÿg8swoiw

Increased traffic due to 'induced demand' is the second dumbest theory I've ever heard after homeopathy.  [LV loop](https://www.lvloop.com/lvccloop) website linked on the Boring company website mentions that a high occupancy vehicle, 16 passenger EV, could be made to carry passengers.  Somehow it would use the Model 3 platform.  &gt;	What is an AEV?   Standard AEVs are Tesla Model X and Model 3 vehicles. High-occupancy AEVs use a modified Tesla Model 3 chassis to transport up to 16 passengers with both sitting and standing room.   I think that’s the leap some are making is from “dense Tesla” to electric bus.  Seems plausible.ÿg8sw3jm

I recommend the Genesis G80. They should fix the issues until it arrives in the US. Also Tesla and the euro brands have issues too (probably bigger issues in comparison). If you want a proven model maybe get a G90 or a Kia K900 (extremely underrated) instead?  Are japanese cars not an option bc of politics?

I wouldn't be surprised if it used more during start up. That being said I would build your system to be able to handle a 4kw load just in case. Inverters especially are notoriously under performing and your battery bank will last significantly longer. I would also look into a tesla power wall. It could easily power that motor with a 5kw rating. You can have it grid tied and when the power goes out you won't even know it. plus you could get rid of your generator completely.ÿg8svbu9

spicewomanÿVeganForCircleJerkersÿ2020-10-14 15:01:35ÿ"Organic sugar specifically is vegan because it's not allowed to use bone char. In most contexts it definitely doesn't mean ""automatically vegan.""  And of course I don't donate *all* ""potential money saved"" by buying technically-non-vegan products; for example, I can't afford a Tesla either way. Or... technically I probably could if I gave up all my savings and lived barely scraping by. But if I took things to that extreme I would be miserable, and a miserable example to those in my life that are becoming more open to veganism as a way of life.   The point is that all those calculations aren't something I keep a running tally on.

nbalbo2010ÿpicsÿ2020-10-14 15:00:39ÿJust my $0.02, but I've recently come to the realization that a lot of people vote based strictly on what's best for them personally, and not for what's best for the country as a whole. This person drives a Tesla, so he/she is likely living a pretty decent life. If person A gets elected vs person B, or vice versa, how much is it really going to change their life? They likely feel/felt that voting doesn't matter because it would take a very severe systemic change for them to feel it very much.  I am fortunate enough to be a 29 y/o with a stable job and little debt, and I would say I live a pretty great life. I'm one of the few people I've talked to that cares if my taxes go up since at the end of the day, it won't change my life significantly. My vote is going out for all of the people who aren't as fortunate as me, who haven't been dealt the best hand, who need help from the system because the system hasn't worked as well for them as it has for me.  My worldview isn't that expansive, but I feel that a big problem with the USA is that  way too many Americans value their lives over others. It feels like this election could be a turning point to help change that, and that may be why this person decided now was the time when voting mattered.ÿg8sv5h3

ArlesChatlessÿelectricvehiclesÿ2020-10-14 14:58:58ÿThere is the slight risk of additional resistance from the extra connection. That's why the UL doesn't allow extension cables for J1772. Kept clean and used sensibly I would not hesitate to use either of these adapters. The other risk is that the adapters don't tell the EVSE their current limit, but since no car except Tesla has an onboard charger rated for more than 40A that's more of an academic concern than anything you need to practically worry about. There has been some word that adapters won't work with every Tesla destination charger, since apparently some look for a VIN back. That's everything I can think of.ÿg8suyiq

falconbergerÿSelfDrivingCarsÿ2020-10-14 14:57:56ÿ"Lol. Every self-driving company, including Waymo, is working on a general solution. Waymo's goal is a self-driving system that can drive on all public roads worldwide in all weather.  I mean, think. Waymo employs one of the smartest people in the field. If they thought Tesla's approach has a better ROI, they would copy it. Tesla's approach means cheaper and worse sensors (Waymo's cameras are much better), order of magnitude less engineers, no need for HD maps.  Tesla can get close to a system that looks good on a high level but fails every 100 kms. And it would turn out to be extremely hard to get to one failure per 100,000 kms. About 8+ years ago, Waymo was ""feature-complete"", they were able to pass a test suite of 10 long routes covering a wide variety of environments."ÿg8suu8r
megamefÿteslamotorsÿ2020-10-14 14:57:49ÿYou can actually charge a Tesla by towing so if you used 100% of the battery of the model 3 you could then tow it until the model X also used 100% if it’s battery and you’d gain some amount of battery back in the 3.

johnhaltonxÿteslainvestorsclubÿ2020-10-14 14:57:45ÿ""" Suppliers will typically go for the smaller guys that can support their  volume requirements. Margins are better, aligned growth and partnerships  are better, less risk of one contract valuations. ""  You're right they want so spread their risk.  counter example: BMW wanted to make long term battery deals in 2018 with CATL/panasonic/lg chem  they tried to get 5/10 year contracts for 30.000+100.000 cars/year? beginning 30.000 end possibly higher volume , these details are not known.  they couldn'get contract with longer durations than 2 years for their volume at an acceptable price. and the suppleirs are oversold some time at the moment. VW and mercedes had to delay production ramps / stop production teporarily because of battery shortages from suppliers...  everything was already sold including the new planned production.  tesla got the  contract for LFP with CATL last year ... and that volume is going to be much higher.  i think our positions are not as far of as it seemed at the beginning, thanks for the time.  &amp;#x200B;  conclusion: risk is high as you said, but best position to achieve the target is tesla (at the moment)"ÿg8sutib

Avian_Archdukeÿmonarchismÿ2020-10-14 14:57:08ÿ"&gt; Authors such as Kästner, Feuchtwanger, Einstein and Remarque, among others, all considered the great German writers of the 20th century, had their works destroyed by the Nazis.  Though I will concede to you that the NSDAP's treatment of Remarque and his work was quite unfair in hindsight, (hence why I said the ""grand majority"" and not all of the books involved deserved their fate) Kaestner, Feuchtwanger, and Einstein were all Marxist agitators, the latter a plagiarist and a liar who was criticized repeatedly by actual genius Nikola Tesla.  &gt; What exactly do you mean by that? They still happened and Germans willingly participated.  The books outlawed from circulation were not mandatorily confiscated by German authorities from their owners; if they wanted to abstain from these voluntary book burnings, this was perhaps socially discrediting, but it was by no means illegal. And again, even most of the banned books were archived.  &gt; Wow it’s almost like an evil regime mass produced propaganda containing its insidious ideas to brainwash the populace over many years, all of which had to be seized after the allied victory to prevent further promulgation of National Socialist ideas.  Except only a third of the books that were banned by the Allies had anything to do with National Socialism at all. Frederick the Great's works were banned, just as one example. If the Allies were only concerned about liberating Germany from ""Nazism"" and not destroying Germany, as they actually did, why would they (including the Western Allies) tear down and blow up statues of Kaisers Wilhelm I and Wilhelm II, and those of many Holy Roman Emperors as well?  &gt; We can debate about how “traditional” the neoclassical sculptures, gargantuan marble blocks and massive eagles of Nazi sculptures really were. Some look imposing to this day, other surviving relics are monstrously ugly.  High art under National Socialist rule was far more than just statues of *Reichsadlern* and *Nordic Man* sculptures. Any painting produced during the period by Hans Schmidt-Wiedenbrueck is objectively superior to those of the so-called ""artists"" that Germany cherishes out of Allied-imposed war guilt.  &gt; That’s not even an argument.  Just because the NSDAP was geared towards modernist architecture doesn't mean it's brutalist. I used Brasilia as an example because it is an actual display of brutalist architecture, and because its architect, Oscar Niemeyer, was a Marxist who intentionally designed everything to be hideous.   NSDAP architecture may be unpleasant to look at, but it was not designed expressly with that intent in the minds of Germany's architects; it was designed for efficiency and relative ease of construction."ÿg8suqwv

I do think we're nearing the end of such a ""clean"" looking chart, so it's time to be a lot more strategic trading it.  I've been hugely bullish on NIO due to the fact that it was undervalued hugely relative to TSLA.  Now it's basically caught up to TSLA on a relative basis and is much more likely to move in-line with TSLA.  Analysts are now openly bullish as opposed to how much more conservative their PTs were a few months ago.  I'm still bullish on the whole because I do expect some kind of blowoff top and NIO is growing its deliveries so rapidly (expecting huge delivery increases throughout 2021), but the stock price is now reflecting that."ÿg8su184
whatsasyriaÿteslainvestorsclubÿ2020-10-14 14:50:46ÿGotta do some work today lol so will respond quickly to the supplier points and pretty much aligned on everything else but what I will say is that the estimates coming out of Tesla today are 100% more reliable then they were say last year. That mismanagement of old guidance was the biggest reason institutional investors hated tesla back then but it has improved immensely. That being said execution risk is still on the high side especially if they try to put out a 25k car with model 3 quality so whether we go low estimates and do low risk or high estimates and high risk, well boil down to similar numbers.   Having been in the manufacturing and supplier side. Suppliers will typically go for the smaller guys that can support their volume requirements.

love2fuckbearthroatÿteslainvestorsclubÿ2020-10-14 14:45:28ÿWe're basically agreeing but you're overlooking the fact that I specifically said that is not my expected value for 2030. (sidenote; to have a $5 T market cap in 2030 that means $5T discounted to 2030 currency, not today, what happens from now till 2030 has no effect on the market cap in 2030 since it is forward looking so you don't need to discount)  Tesla doesn't even need to expand to different markets for that $5T in 2030, that number is based on ~$2T/$2T/$1T for automotive, autonomous taxis and energy. They do need to achieve their target numbers, which adds risk but all I said was that if they do execute on that they can achieve that market cap. I would never buy stock today assuming it WILL be $5T in 2030. For example I would want 10% year over year on my investment plus maybe a 50% uncertainty that they will get there. In that example the expected value for $2030 would be $2.5T and I would have it discounted 10% yoy to be $480/share today. Note these are just example numbers, yours may differ.   What you assumed from my post, which is not accurate, is that I said Tesla will become $5T in 2030 and that I would be willing to place bets based on that expected value. I said it is my bull case, and they CAN achieve it.ÿg8stes2

johnhaltonxÿteslainvestorsclubÿ2020-10-14 14:43:51ÿi used the megapacks because they are the worst from a profit/kwh perspective.  and yes raw materials are going to be a major bottleneck. which manufacturer is going their supply chain upwards to mining ... tesla.  which manufacturer would you want to sell to as cell producer?  somebody who buys 20-30gwh/year or somebody who buys 100+gwh/year...  tesla will have the advantage from 3rd party suppliers because their volume is going to be higher.  well lets look... battery manufacturing is planned for texas, berlin and cato road. cato road is planned for 10gwh/line. What tesla didnt's say on battery day. they have 2 Lines at cato road .... up to 20gwh/year runrate end of 2021  production lines planned at 20gwh/line/year in berlin/texas/shanghai  shanghai is panned for 1 million cars complete built out  berlin is 2 million cars  texas is unknown at the moment but based on size it should be berlin+ so 2 million+  including fremont, thats 5.6 million cars/year potentially  for 20 million cars/year in 2030 they would need an additional 6 factories of about 2.5million/year capacity  6 factories over 6-7 years ( buildout berlin/shanghai/texas over the next 3 years) is 1 factory/year berlin is planned to cost 4 billion for 1 million/year output. with enough land to double that at a later point so 8 billion/2million cars/year assuming the do not get more cost effective( unlikely). that would be 8 billion/year starting in 2023.  at \~1.5 million cars/year run rate end of 2023   revenue at about 60 billion (linearly scaled from q2 2020  pandemic quarter)  gross profit at 15 billion ( assuming no operating leverage linearly scaled from q2 2020  pandemic quarter)  opex at 6 billion ( linearly scaled would be lower because scales slower than gross profit)  \~9 billion give or take... it could barely work, but almost all assumptions are on the low end.  yes there is executing risk, but that risk applies to the competition also. And the competition has fewer inhouse knowledge especially for batteries than tesla because it is far more important for tesla thatn and manufacturer who sells primalily ICE vehicles.  I don't say that has to happen, but if somebody is in the best position to get there its tesla at the moment.  Robotaxis are not included as risk adjustment, if they happen that could double the valuation over the next 5 years after the network start( very rough guess have not thought about the quantitative impact of that)ÿg8st832

Every single one of these products have exceeded my expectations.   &amp;#x200B;  I had a single power optimizer go  out on my roof and it took about 4 phone calls to Tesla to get it fixed.

Nothing I can do in the app will un-break it from there so I have to force-kill the Tesla app and go back into summon again to get it going again.

As far as the business environment goes its sure worth trying as the country iz 6th largest in population with very minimal connectivity options available. I may sound desperate but 60% of population in here is below 30 and wanted a stable connection.

The company, run by billionaire Elon Musk, hasn’t responded to inquiries from Bloomberg and other media outlets for nearly a year, and many of the people who were in communications roles have moved on to jobs at other tech companies. Chief Executive Officer Musk does appear on podcasts and is an avid user of Twitter.  ---  We did have an article from Electrek about Tesla's PR - I guess there is a question of why have PR when Electrek and Clean Technica can do it for Tesla for the Western world?  https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/j636zf/tesla_dissolves_its_pr_department_a_new_first_in/  One matter the article does gloss over is that in the long run, the Chinese government will want its domestic players to win the domestic market.ÿg8ss4ji

However, the battery is probably the most significant and vital part of the vehicle (don't take it from me, Tesla dedicated an event for it.)   HW4-10, dash changes, strut, design all changes/improves overtime.   However, for the battery, a 16% increase means and mass reductions means longer range (potentially over 400) which means time saved at charging stations, time = money.

I just skipped to Tesla part so I don't know if he mentioned somewhere in between but here are some things the he has said previously.   ""I told you a long time ago that I thought that we'd make 20 times our money in Tesla. So far we've made four times."" Tesla was around $200 at the time so that would imply that he is expecting Tesla to go to $1000 since they already had made their money 4 times so they are still expecting at least 5 times from there so that would imply 1T market cap.  ""Tesla, that's going to be $2,000 or $3,000 in five years and a multiple of that over the next five years"" This was said in 2020 so split adjusted that means 400 or 600 in 2025.  ""I now think we're going to make double or triple again for the next five years, and double or triple again over the next five years. I think there's 10 times more to go in Tesla before I have to even think about this if we're right."" Tesla was around 200 per share so double or triple next 5 years would be 400 or 600 in 2025. Double or triple from that is then minimum of 800 or maximum of 1800 which would be the price in 2030. Or if you take his ""10 times to go"" then 2000. This would imply 2T market cap.  Those numbers are so far from 10T that I find it hard to believe that he ever said that."ÿg8srqsk

In my family 10 people own a Tesla, they're not liberal at all. 3 of my neighbors have them, 2 are very skeptical about this election and will probably not vote they said, 1 is the only guy in the area with a ""jo"" sign in the yard.

acidmingoutÿBitLifeAppÿ2020-10-14 14:25:14ÿIdeas for overhaul:     - Maintenance and Upgrades improve condition of               your car    - Driving dangerously can result in: figures of 8, speeding, hooning, DUI, Failing to stop at traffic lights and of course car accidents    - Car accidents can be covered by insurance saving you costly amounts in case of a car crash    - The other party of the car crash might demand compensatiom that can be paid through insurance or cash    - Many more car models added including brands like tesla     - Change the colour of your car with paint job option    - Owning high quality cars improves your chances of finding more desirable women in the hookup and dating app options    - Your cars may be stolen or vandalised  Hopefully this makes it to the devs :) Other suggestions would be interesting tooÿg8sr4pz

JeffsProjectsÿEVConversionÿ2020-10-14 14:23:52ÿThe layout you want would be best done by mounting a Leaf or Tesla motor and transaxle. That’s too much weight to put on the suspension, and it’s not really designed for it. It’d be an awful thing to build.   That being said, direct drive with no transmission is totally a possibility. My MG uses a K11 linked to the rear differential only by a driveshaft. I’m running it at 200V and 1000A peak, though. Fitting the electric motor in the transmission tunnel would be the ideal scenario, with the engine bay for batteries.ÿg8sqzbl

I think #5 is a huge reason for our world right now. Social media and the internet have made hype stocks soar and day trading apps also add to the noise. I do not think people fully understand the rock solid company that Berkshire is because it takes a little research and intelligence. Also, it is so massive that it is basically like an ETF. People think 'Tesla' and they see a nice car on the road and it is as easy as ""Oh, Tesla = nice car.""

So we are not only looking at very huge price tags on IT tech around the year 1990, we're also looking at wages about half of what they are today. For the money that would buy you a ""high end"" 80486 machine in 1990, you could buy a Tesla Model 3 today. Computers were insanely expensive. It's interesting that people seem to either have forgotten about this or, are completely unaware of what a luxury product a computer was.   I'm glad those days are over.

St_Bernardusÿpicsÿ2020-10-14 14:20:45ÿA Tesla is the number 1 car people upgrade to when they switch from a prius. A ton of the model 3 drivers (their largest volume car by far) have never bought a luxury car before and are not as wealthy as you think anyway. And for the really wealthy who don't care about the cost of gas there are more luxurious options in traditional cars for now until electric models like the lucid air come out or there is an update to the higher end Teslas. Anti Electric car propaganda is much more heavily circulated on conservative media and tesla doesn't themselves advertise. Tesla owners are definitely more on the liberal side.ÿg8sqmyr

Again, I said that IF everything goes right Tesla CAN get a $5T market cap, I never said that is the expected value. It is my bull case.  I didn't grab the $5T out of thin air, happy to clarify but I'll need something more than ""lol stop"" to counter it."ÿg8sqih4

berger3001ÿelectricvehiclesÿ2020-10-14 14:15:43ÿAgree to a certain extent, but even with the $14000 rebates under the liberals, it appeared that no car companies excerfor Tesla had any interest in selling evs in much of Ontario. Kia dealerships didn’t have any to even looks at, GM had 7% financing, and lease terms and rates assumed the car would be worthless after the end of lease. Most of the bolts got transferred to Quebec. I think it was the fault of the companies for not making any effort to sell the cars, and therefore not selling any cars. With few sales, why offer new models?ÿg8sq39m

Other factor is NIO is now approaching a valuation similar to TSLA on a relative basis (production/revenue-wise), which was a big part of my thesis for why it was undervalued.  I think going forward it will likely mimic TSLA more than it has recently.  I'm expecting a blowoff top at some point, just not sure when it'll happen.ÿg8spjvq

PamAnderson360ÿstocksÿ2020-10-14 14:07:48ÿSeriously, no problem. Happy to help! Always start with the caveat that my perspective is far from comprehensive and you should always do your own DD before making investing decisions.   With that in mind I’ve recently reoriented the growth part of my portfolio (roughly 60%). I mostly use ETFs to get exposure to growth industries like clean energy and online retail. That’s included increasing my positions in ICLN, IBUY, and a few ARK ETFs like ARKK and ARKF.   It’s worth noting that many of the growth ETFs (including the ones I listed) are trading at all time highs, so this may not be the best time to rotate into them. I am an active advocate of ICLN, and even if you snag a few shares during a small drawback, I’d say that’s money well placed if your investing timeline is &lt; 5 years.   Specific to the EV space, it’s challenging to invest. On the one hand, TSLA is a genuinely incredible company that is profoundly changing the entire auto-industry. On the other hand, it’s outrageously overvalued. There are some promising long term investments, particularly Chinas NIO but obviously this comes with substantial risk.   How long have you been investing? What are your investment goals? What is your investment timeline? What is your tolerance for risk? All important to understand.ÿg8sp99o

whatsasyriaÿteslainvestorsclubÿ2020-10-14 14:07:40ÿMost manufacturers probably won't go for the bigger packs. You'll start seeing 20-40 become the standard.   Its silly to think that if the market opportunity is there people won't ramp up. Up untill a few years ago tesla didn't plan at being at 3tw. You'll also see the current suppliers making new relationships.  You also have to think that is tesla actually capable of building a quality car on par with let's say a camry at scale for 25k....that is the only way they will hit the volume they need. Currently they are not producing a 100k+ car that competes with the quality of a camry so to think this ramp up is going to be smooth is naive. Theyll need to deploy atleast another 6 gigafactories and have everything scaled up. With scale also comes new challenges and corporate governance they need to start accounting for.   To support your point though the bottleneck is going to become raw materials.   Look my position speaks for itself that I support tesla but thinking 5T or even 3T in ten years is a freebie is blind loyalty which is never a good investment approach.ÿg8sp8sl

Sort of expecting ID.3 to do well based on the hype/interest.  That being said, there's a whole lot of new products with pent-up demand coming out of the pipeline for the competitors.  Europe (more than other markets) is sort in a state of purgatory where there's so much noise and moving parts, it's really hard to pin down exact ""organic demand"" for these cars.

wherearemyfeetÿukpoliticsÿ2020-10-14 14:02:42ÿ&gt; The precautionary principle is very important when it comes to technologies that interface with our bodies in a way like food (or medical technology in the case of the doc) does.  The Precautionary Principle only applies to unknown and new technologies. That is absolutely not the case with GM, because the sheer weight of evidence in support of it is huge. Not just that but the biggest scientific body in support of that scentific consensus on GM safety is........ the EU!  &gt; The... elected representative body in charge of managing the regulatory environment we live in?  You see why people didn't hold favourable views of them then? If there were an actual health concern then fine, but it was a purely political move that means we can't use a technology that has clear benefits for UK farmers and buyers. It'd be like the EU banning Tesla because they're worried about the impact of Tesla sales on Peugeot or VW: that's not where they should be exercising that power.ÿg8soq2y

The EU has been introducing progressively tougher emissions regulations and trying to green their economy for many years.   In 2018 Ontario elected Doug Ford whose first action was to kill ALL green policies at any cost - he cancelled the cap-and-trade program, removed excellent EV incentives (""for rich Tesla owners""), removed the program that subsidized EV charging installations, forced the [dismantling of in-progress wind installations](https://countysustainabilitygroup.com/2019/10/30/white-pines-demolition-mourned-as-ford-dismantles-green-energy-in-ontario/) and on and on.

Ovidestusÿnextfuckinglevelÿ2020-10-14 13:59:40ÿdisclaimer: I am almost guessing here. I am just writing this so I would get corrected so I'd learn.  I am not knowledgeable, but I'd think yes. The current is going through a wire which practically has no resistance. Through air it's dropping quickly due to the resistance in air. A wire gives you the entire package by not having a voltage drop until it touches you, where the resistance is very high at one single point.  However in this tesla gun, if you look at the video he says that the _secondary_ coil has micro amperes, meaning that it already gets out with little current. So if you fire directly from there, you should be fine, but it is dependent on how long it is connected to you. Current is as fatal as the time it is going through you.   I wish someone could explain better to me, because I think I am close to guessing here.ÿg8soel9

While deathmarks were buffed considerably into an actually unit instead of being a deep striking example warrior in the elite slo like it used to be I don’t think it will be used much outside of for fun.  As far as gauss vs tesla it just comes down to the fact it isn’t worth spending 2 more points per model on tesla, I really can’t understand their thought process with that decision at the same cost it would be more of a coin flip based on what you expect to face but as it gauss is clearly better after all the buffs and cost reduction.ÿg8so9ge

In Lidar, the photons are generated by the Lidar system while in camera, it depends on ambient light or car headlight.  If a Lidar can determine if a object is a rectangle, then Camera can do that as long as it's able to see 4D (time element), because as the car travels, you'll should be able to make out the sign is on a rectangular object and not the standard hexagon object that stop signs are associated with. (I believe Tesla shown this during autonomy day)    ""Tesla's Autopilot system depends largely on cameras and, to a lesser extent, radar, while more truly autonomous vehicles like those developed by Waymo, Uber, or GM-owned autonomous vehicle startup Cruise also integrate laser-based lidar, points out Charlie Miller, the lead autonomous vehicle security architect at Cruise. ""Lidar would not have been susceptible to this type of attack,"" says Miller. ""You can change an image on a billboard and lidar doesn’t care, it’s measuring distance and velocity information. So these attacks wouldn't have worked on most of the truly autonomous cars out there."""""ÿg8smjbw

I got KMB with her wep, and Miko sakura with 3rd relic ( she was useful and very new back then). So a month ago I got the chance to roll for HoT and got her with Mag storm for free, I also got 2 blood rose card from the dorm using cards only (now she is close to being ss).   Also got luck in the recent gacha event  I got 2 un utu, 1surtr, undine, eos gloria , robert pery M and tesla band T The other wep that I have are Florid sakura and balmung sword. Stigmas are just Jingwei T ,Zorro M and tesla band M.  As of now I am struggling on physical valks I have my NS is only at A and SP at A also. The only physical valks that I have at S are KMB ,Miko,Ranger, Triumph and Imayoh.  I don't know what to prioritize first according to what I have right now. Hopefully you can help me.

jurc11ÿStarlinkÿ2020-10-14 13:31:54ÿ"   # Tibro: when Starlink advances hidden behind front companies  [**Eric Bottlaender**](https://www.clubic.com/auteur/2054-eric-bottlaender.html)**Space specialist**October 13, 2020 at 8:55 am[**Kevin Larat**](https://www.clubic.com/auteur/2250-kevin-larat.html)October 13, 2020 at 8:55 am[**12**](https://www.clubic.com/pro/personnalites-e-business/elon-musk/actualite-17010-tibro-quand-starlink-avance-masquee-derriere-des-societes-ecrans-en-europe.html#commentaires)**📷**  **In Australia, the Netherlands, Spain and even in France: everything suggests that SpaceX is bringing Starlink through the service door by creating several shell companies named Tibro since 2019, which are emerging as and when .**   **Here is a strange constellation… on the ground.**     Do you know Tibro? No ? It's normal. This small EURL, with a modest capital of 7,500 euros, was created on September 20, 2019, as a goodwill based in Paris. The address also refers to a stone's throw from the Champs-Elysées, rue de la Boétie, on a building which notably houses the commercial premises of “Clope &amp; Phone” which is quite hilarious considering what follows. At first glance, nothing exciting, if we except a little play on words: Tibro backwards reads ""orbit"". That, and the fact that the company was founded by Michael James Sylvester.  **Read also:**   [**All you need to know about Starlink, the constellation that wants to put fiber into orbit**](https://www.clubic.com/spacex/article-875742-1-galaxie-starlink-fibre-orbite.html)**📷**  ## The very active Mr. Sylvester  Mr. Sylvester is a very busy man. At first glance, you might think that even though he lives in California, he believes very much in the potential of his Tibro business. Because he didn't just create Tibro France: he also created Tibro Corp. in Great Britain, Tibro Netherlands BV in September 2019, then a Tibro branch in 2020 in Madrid, and another Tibro gMBH in Austria, as well as in Ireland.  Tibro could even be exported all over the world, since there is also Tibro Japan, and Tibro Australia. Definitely, Michael Sylvester must have a concrete concept. But not really what to be surprised, since on the profile which most resembles that of Mr. Sylvester, we learn that this one is tax manager for SpaceX. Maybe he had a revelation on the spot to launch Tibro and enjoy a new international career (as well as a little love of the word game)?  **📷**  ## Tibro, a facade for SpaceX?  Maybe not. Because behind Tibro is in fact hiding the employer of Mr. Sylvester, SpaceX, in a rather clever maneuver. Let's take a look at Australia first, from TIBRO AUSTRALIA PTY LTD. The company, created in November 2019, is writing an application to ACMA (the Australian communications authority) to obtain a ""  *carrier license* "" - in short, to become an operator. License granted on August 7, 2020.  And if you are wondering what the Tibro company wants to do in Australia, look no further. Since October 3, Tibro has changed its name! Mr. Sylvester's company is now called Starlink Australia PTY LTD. Astonishing, no?  Starlink, it should be added, is SpaceX's great constellation of internet connectivity. A titanic project intended to connect the world, started in 2015 and whose first satellites took off in May 2019. The constellation will initially have at least 4,400 units, and possibly 30,000 satellites. Since August 2020, SpaceX has had enough transponders in orbit to start, in high latitudes, the first private beta experiments.  Also be aware that Australia is of great interest to Starlink, as it is a rich country with large spaces that are difficult to connect to traditional networks. A little research reveals that SpaceX is already deploying four Starlink terminals in Australia on an experimental basis.  **📷**  ## SpaceX is not hidden far away  Tibro is therefore transformed into Starlink: is it a coincidence, or is there a will at SpaceX to create ten legal entities in 2019 and possibly transform them afterwards?  Tibro and SpaceX share links that are easy to find, when you know where to look. Take Tibro Corp, registered in the United Kingdom: as you might expect, Mr. Sylvester is well listed as a director, with an address in Delaware - which is only a letterbox, the building housing Incorporate. .com, a company whose specialty is precisely to host companies. You know of at least one other firm registered at the same address in New Castle: Space Exploration Technologies Corp.  There is also the Dutch example, that of Tibro Netherlands BV. It is created on September 12, 2019 (you guessed who is the manager). This time the address south of Amsterdam does not take us to SpaceX, but… to Tesla! And it's not just a sales and service center, but Tesla's headquarters for the so-called EMEA ( *Europe, Middle-East and Africa* ) area. The mailboxes must undoubtedly jostle on the spot, since it is the same address for SpaceX Netherlands BV. A company founded by Michael Sylvester in April (zero suspense)… but which is already used by SpaceX in general, and Starlink in particular.  In a request to the Federal Communications Commission (the powerful FCC) in July 2020, the same address as Tibro, SpaceX and Tesla in the Netherlands was used as a reference to list the manufacturer's European regulator. of satellites.  And if all that wasn't enough, Tibro Netherlands BV also changed its name in September. To call itself, again without suspense, Starlink Holdings Netherlands BV.  Indeed since September, Tibro is in decline, and Starlink moving forward. Tibro in the Netherlands is now called Starlink, and Mr. Sylvester is no longer the manager. These are Lauren Dreyer (Director of Human Resources of SpaceX) and David Anderman (Legal Director of SpaceX… therefore the boss of Mr. Sylvester) who took over. These same two names are found when another company was created, this time in England: Starlink Internet Services UK Limited. Again in Ireland, it's the same corporate hosting company in Dublin that used to house Tibro and now hosts Starlink.  **📷**  ## Why advance masked?  It remains to be understood why SpaceX, rather than establishing a single ""Starlink Internet Services"" in an accommodating country (Ireland, on the off chance), preferred to create a dozen entities around the world, and particularly in Europe. This is undoubtedly a legal practice, but it is quite the opposite of what we are used to with SpaceX: effective, public, global communication, which sometimes goes a little too far ... Not an entity that settles under pseudonym abroad.  Perhaps this is rooted in the fact that as of 2019 as yet, Starlink's feasibility may not have been established for SpaceX. Or is it a question of independence? Within SpaceX, we know that Elon Musk does not want to let Starlink take off on its own on the stock market before the constellation is profitable. It may not always have been that way. Is this still a way of advancing the issue of the allocation of frequencies necessary for the distribution of terminals as an operator?  Today, not all Tibros are transformed, and obviously not all of them served as a “fulcrum” for Starlink before changing their name.  It also remains to be seen whether in Paris, Starlink will remain at the same address as ""Clope &amp; Phone"" ..."ÿg8slksz

SlimVRÿscootersÿ2020-10-14 13:29:26ÿI fucking hate electric scooters. They break down and require an electrician, in addition to a traditional scooter mechanic for repairs and maintenance. You can't get replacement body plastic panels. They aren't mass produced enough to invest in. You break it, and have to buy another one. Too expensive for that nonsense. Can't zip around all day at WOT on them, you'll deplete the battery in minutes. The torque is strong and eventually strips the gear on the rear hub/axle.   A reputable company needs to create a proper E-scooter hybrid with gas motor. Maybe something like Tesla, Honda, Toyota, etc. I'm pretty sure the majority of all E-scooter components and assembly are from Mainland China. I'll pass until we get batteries that can last a week on a charge, and both battery and scooter come with 5 year, unlimited mileage warranty, fully transferable to each different new/used owner. And there must be a dealership network and repair facilities in major cities and states.Till then, I'm sticking with gas scooters.ÿg8slc6j

As an American it does make me laugh when people say “we don’t want to have the government take half our money and be socialist!” Because essentially they already do but they don’t give us services in return. When you add up almost 30% in state &amp; federal income tax, 6% sales tax on all purchases, 15% capital gains taxes, and all other misc.  taxes and property transfer fees, it’s pretty close to 50%. And even then I have to pay for my own insurance and an x-ray still cost me $750 recently even with that haha. But this is a tesla forum, and I digress...ÿg8sksea

RJJVORSRÿelectricvehiclesÿ2020-10-14 13:15:56ÿSmart of you to get insurance quotes before buying. $270/m is outrageous. May as well self-insure at that price. I have read that insurance companies are afraid of EVs because one bump in a parking lot that cracks the battery will write-off the whole car. Teslas also suffer from having very few places to repair them.  I would be interested to know the quotes you get for other cars.  The choices you're naming are quite different from one another. A Tesla 3 is a sedan. A Kona is a SUV. A base 3 costs more than a loaded Kona. I think you need to decide what kind of car you want, what your must-have feaures are, and what your budget is.ÿg8sk173

I think a fitting example is how each company's management handled the rona:  Elon Musk - We are opening up our tesla factory during peak corona. If you want to come arrest me, I'm on the shop floor.  Jeff Bezos - Fuck it we are in biz and need to deliver these packages. Let's also launch some rockets (to which the employees pushed back).  Richard Branson/Whitesides - Oh let's hold off six months and make some operational protocols that add bureaucracy to the system/work flow to protect against a virus that has a 0.15% death rate.

We have no control over how those things turn out. Tesla has already proven their manufacturing skills with EVs so if you invest to that then you are investing based on proven facts. If you invest based on that their FSD or solar (in race to bottom) will be multi trillion dollar business then you are investing based on hope. Yes they have one of the best changes doing it but none of those are done deal and we are far from finish line. I have invested because I believe their EV business.

b0ltzmann138e-23ÿRealTeslaÿ2020-10-14 13:07:54ÿI think the goal of the ICE would be to keep the car on the highway going 80MPH without draining the battery. So you can go on a road trip and not worry about charging. How much HP does that generator need to be?  According to [this](https://cleantechnica.com/2018/08/19/tesla-model-3-is-the-most-efficient-electric-car-on-highways/#:~:text=According%20to%20ABRP's%20data%2C%20the,efficiency%20is%20still%20very%20impressive.)  it is 157 Wh/km at 120 km/h (in ideal conditions)  Since we can't expect ideal conditions, let's use the round figure of of 200 Wh/km at 120 km/h  200 Wh/km * 120 km/h = 24000 Watts or 24kw.  1 HP ~ 0.75 kw so for 24kw you would need ~32HP generator would be enough to keep you going down the highway at 120km/h indefinitely in a model 3.  All you need is a battery large enough to get you to highway speed and drive around in stop and go traffic where the ICE is very inefficient. The volt had a 18KWh battery pack and got about 40 miles of range on electric. So anything in that range would me more than enough.  For those allergic to the metric system, 120km/h ~ 75MPHÿg8sja2t

So I haven’t driven much since... which reminds me that I should stop by Costco and have my wheels rotated and balanced. :)   I decided to try Michelin Crossclimate+ since they do have the 3 peak (severe snow service  rated) icon for snowy weather. They seem too be only a little less efficient than the oem rubber.   I was originally planning to do a winter wheel set and a summer wheel set, but I changed my mind when I came across newer tires like CC+ that seemed to carry much better winter ratings on an all season. Also, the annoyance of storing and swapping wheels factored in. And the significant loss of efficiency on sticky performance rubber. We’ll see how the CC+ works out. I don’t usually have persistent snow/ice in winters, but I do get some storms where snow/ice might stick around for several days.ÿg8siumo

moonpumperÿteslainvestorsclubÿ2020-10-14 12:53:01ÿYeah because they can go from vague announcement to full scale product launch before Tesla comes along and trounces all of those numbers. As soon as a spec sheet and a launch date comes out Tesla will have something ready. How long did Lucid's range superiority last? It didn't last at all because the Air isn't even going to be in full scale production before Plaid S. I swear Tesla just sits in this stuff waiting for competition to spring up at this point.ÿg8shxj8

SlavasonicÿNecrontyrÿ2020-10-14 12:51:31ÿEach unit does different things.   Immortals are basically just more durable troops. Durability and obsec are very valuable things. In general though I think gauss is the better option than tesla at the moment (which is sad cause I have 30 tesla immortals and no gauss). The boards are smaller and their range is longer so rapid fire range shouldn’t be too difficult, gauss has better strats, AP is really useful, and they’re cheaper for some reason.   Deathmarks are durable back line objective holders with enough firepower to make opponents play a bit more defensive with their characters.   Both units I think are viable.ÿg8shss1

SippieCupÿteslamotorsÿ2020-10-14 11:56:10ÿTesla has billions of miles driven on autopilot. It doesn't have billions of miles at its fingertips. It only has a few million fully sampled (not labeled) driving miles at most.  Every car on the road is not uploading 7 1080p video streams along with every can message sent back to the mothership. It gets still images from the fleet and sometimes a 7 second video of full data.   Second, maybe read the paper..  &gt;There is a lot of excitement for end-to-end learning approaches to driving which typically focus on learning to directly predict raw control outputs such as steering or braking after consuming raw sensor input such as camera or lidar data. But to reduce sample complexity, we opt for mid-level input and output representations that take advantage of perception and control components. We use a perception system that processes raw sensor information and produces our input: a top-down representation of the environment and intended route, where objects such as vehicles are drawn as oriented 2D boxes along with a rendering of the road information and traffic light states.   Oh shit, they did exactly what I said they did. Tesla is also taking this exact approach...   Third autoML is not unsupervised. They are talking about end-to-end training methodolgy and the tuning of hyperparameters and network heads to find the best combination of these parameters which results in an optimal model. Sometimes its based on Resnet, sometimes its based on efficentnet, etc.ÿg8sddhk

ballisonÿteslainvestorsclubÿ2020-10-14 11:55:00ÿ&gt; To encourage users of the video-sharing platform to participate in its campaign, MSCHF is offering rewards for every “takedown” video, provided that they hit a target number of views. In Tesla’s case, the internet group is offering $1,000 for every video that attacks the electric car maker, provided that they hit 500,000 views or more. Interestingly enough, the custom sound that MSCHF created for Tesla takedown videos featured Elon Musk’s name in the popular song “Bad Guy” by Billie Eilish.  &gt;  &gt; As could be seen on MSCHF’s official page, its recent campaign is mainly aimed at “killing” brands that it deems evil or are participating in questionable actions. TikTok, for example, is a $10 target due to its “content suppression” initiatives, Amazon is a $100 target for its “human rights violations and union busting,” and Facebook is a $4,000 target due to its proliferation of “hate speech and fake news.” Tesla, for its part, became a target over its alleged “employee health negligence and union busting.”ÿg8sdai0

Euler007ÿelectricvehiclesÿ2020-10-14 11:18:13ÿQuick napkin math, using the average state plus federal excise tax (54.78 cents) and the total gasoline consumption (142.71 billion gallons), the states and federal government took in 78 billion from gasoline taxes. For diesel, that's 61.88 cents times 47.2 billion gallons, so another 29.21 billion. So they kicked back about 20% of what they taxed their products, mostly to make US upstream and refining competitive and reduce imports.  I'm just stating a fact, not that I'm against it. In fact I'm buying an EV next year because it's the cheapest option from, between subsidies, one year amortization, unsubscribing from the gasoline taxes (which are higher in Canada), and free toll bridge I'm being paid to switch. It's a fact that governments are subsidizing the EV market. Tesla made 1.3B$ in the  last three years selling regulatory credits, that's more than the sum of all the profitable quarters of Tesla, combined.ÿg8satfb

one_thousand_necronsÿNecrontyrÿ2020-10-14 11:00:41ÿThe Annihilation Barge actually has quite a lot going for it. Reasonable toughness with Quantum Shielding, great mobility, and good damage against its preferred targets. Compared to the same number of points spent on Tesla Immortals, the Annihilation Barge has more damage, more wounds, better toughness, Living Metal, much better Move and the FLY keyword.  Unfortunately it takes up a valuable Heavy Support slot, and its preferred targets are low-toughness infantry with bad saves. It's not too great against much else, and Necrons already have a ton of anti-horde firepower built in. Also, the new Quantum Shielding rule does not really reward lists that go all-in on it like the old one did.  The Immortals, it's main competitors, also have some big advantages. Having 1 Wound each makes it easy to waste excess enemy damage, especially with all of the flat 2 and 3 damage weapons now which will shred an Annihilation Barge. Immortals also get Objective Secured, and are much better in melee if that counts for anything. The real value of Reanimation Protocols is still up for debate, but they get that too.  Overall the Annihilation Barge is not bad, but it's kind of redundant and for only a few points more you can bring something really good, like a Canoptek Doomstalker or a Triarch Stalker, or somethign really useful like a Ghost Ark.ÿg8s9qv3

noelcowardspeaksoutÿFuturologyÿ2020-10-14 10:56:55ÿZinc-air batteries are worth looking at (see below). I have seen these prices come down to $30 per kw of storage. So say the grid supply price is 5c cents per kw, if you supply 1kw to the grid 600 times you have recouped your cost (APPROX). This makes sense to wind power supply companies who can use surplus wind energy from the small hours to recharge the batteries for free.   There is a lot effort and testing into making hydrogen / ammonia with the 'free energy' too. The two will work well in union with lithium batteries for back up. IMO  That's a great link. I've been advocating for intelligent car chargers to fill in power gaps for a while. I did not know this was up and running. A Tesla is enough for several days worth of power for one house, so in the future all combined EV's will represent an excellent battery bank.  https://www.rechargenews.com/transition/new-zinc-air-battery-is-cheaper-safer-and-far-longer-lasting-than-lithium-ion/2-1-812068ÿg8s9iva

seehrovoloccipÿstupidpolÿ2020-10-14 10:52:26ÿI wouldn’t say that, or rather I’d say odds are we really are hitting a limit of whatever “privately funded” research and production is supposed to be capable of. Nuclear energy, for instance; it will basically never be profitable, it’s got too many upfront costs and not enough long term pay offs from the perspective of a private firm. However, nuclear energy is one of the few power sources with a realistic chance of being able to generally replace fossil fuels as the bedrock for energy supply. Therefore, nuclear energy, which may be needed due to climate change and the ever falling return on fossil fuel investments, can only be implemented be implemented via state directive, and indeed, this is mostly how nuclear energy has been implemented. Furthermore, the furthest research on the potential energy replacements for fission (that is, nuclear fusion research) was primarily conducted by state research, as well, it was primarily the state (the Soviet state, that is) that drafted plans for implementation. Space travel will similarly, likely not be profitable in a short enough time frame for any firm to just...choose to embark on the endeavor, even the firms that attempt to such as Tesla are heavily subsidized by the US government.   There was, during he Thatcher government, a phrase. This phrase was used to justify the neoliberal counterrevolution, that phrase being that there “Is No Alternative”. This, imo, has become more than merely a catchphrase but entire mode of thought; the idea that whatever private capital cannot will itself to do must therefore be impossible with regards to the physical limitations of the universe itself or human ability. The Left itself became infected with this mode of thought during the 1980s and 90s when socialists, communists, and anarchists altogether began to “accept” that their goals were impossible and that the supremacy of the market was not only absolute but also, in a strange sense, preferable.   Why am I saying this? TINA has not only mapped the contours of what we see as *politically* possible, but even what we believe is scientifically and technologically possible.ÿg8s99ng

AkSeminoleÿVanLifeÿ2020-10-14 10:50:07ÿAlternatively, you could convert your van to a parallel hybrid and put something like an entire Tesla pack... somewhere.  Then you could charge your van and drive on solar.. (but keep in mind that with the amount of solar panels that you could mount on a van, you would only be able to charge at most, between 2-5 kWh per day and something as big and poorly aerodynamic as a van would probably get really atrocious miles per kWh... in other words, you might be able to drive 2-5 miles per day on a full days charge depending on variables that are too numerous to go into right now. I would suspect the lower number as most likely.)ÿg8s94si

happyhappypeelpeelÿFuturologyÿ2020-10-14 10:44:24ÿ"To me, this is a much deeper problem than this specific case of billboard signs. This is just a subset of a much larger class of problems, which is that machine vision systems have weird weaknesses that are exploitable in surprising ways. For instance, a pattern that looks like a little tiny bit of noise (or nothing at all) but makes the car see a person. Or another car. Or a road that doesn't exist. It is fascinating and kinda scary.   Certainly there are tricky contexts that are somewhat excusable. My main point is that we should be trying to root out what makes them tricky and eliminate or alleviate it as much as possible. So many Tesla fans just want to excuse everything like we've arrived at the perfect solution, instead of recognizing that there is a long way to go. Not lumping you in with them btw, that's just been my experience on Reddit.   And Tesla (read Elon) is just dead-set on this stubborn path of only ever using cameras because, I don't know, only losers combine multiple technologies to make more robust systems I guess. My prediction is that Tesla will incorporate LIDAR once it becomes powerful, ubiquitous, and cheap. We're already well on the way (iPhone 12 a good example). At that point Elon will say ""aha, that was the plan all along!"" and pretend he didn't spend 20 years shit-talking other technology in a way akin to saying ""pfft, you'll never be able to fit a computer inside a house!"" like luddites past.  But I uh...digress.   So back to the billboard, my response - and I generally agree with what you're saying - is that yes, a whole lot of things enter into the equation. Could a sensor be faulty? Could a sign be impromptu due to construction? Could it be raining? Yes to all of those, and those are all common. A fully self-driving, hands-off system must be able to handle them all with aplomb. Day after day. Year after year. It isn't an option. It is what they *must* be able to do to be functional fully autonomous systems. What other choice is there, unless we want to keep it a twitchy, unsafe mess forever?  I do disagree with your statement that it must regard traffic signs however. Not sure where you live but there are so many access roads and exits on highways that you are constantly seeing signs for roads you're not actually driving on. There might be a 25mph access road right two lanes over from your 75mph highway, separated only by a low median. This is hardly an edge case. The car must be perceptive enough to recognize which signs can be disregarded and which can't. Humans can do it without thinking, and a fully autonomous car needs to be able to do it at least as well.  This whole discussion really illustrates how far we might be from true L5 driving. This is why AI experts cringe at Elon's statements so much. A true L5 system can't just be a long list of rules. You will always be chasing more and more edge cases, more regressions on every update. Look at the state of literally any big software package in any industry. Chances are it's a heaping pile of shit, spaghetti code, inefficiencies, forgotten bugs. That's not good enough for L5. It has to be able to *think*, which is why the sentiment that we won't have L5 until we have human-level general AI is fairly common. Because that's what you might need to do it.  Don't get me wrong I'd love to be able to hop in a van, lay on a queen mattress and watch TV or play Half-Life (or preferably annoy my GF) while my car drives me places, but that won't be a reality til the car can figure this stuff out."ÿg8s8t2l
papriccapwnÿwallstreetbetsÿ2020-10-14 10:44:10ÿNo. I can tell what you are referring to is SELLING a covered call. What these guys want you to do is BUY a call. If your option doesn’t hit strike price by expiration when you BUY you lose 100 percent of your investment.   This is just the start though and you have to take into account intrinsic and extrinsic value and also understand puts. It is quite simple once you figure it out but I would look for one of those 2 hour lectures on YouTube.  That being said, your plan of selling a cash covered call is way less risky. You actually own the shares so you only lose money on the shares when it ranks. Selling the ccc actually takes off some risk of losing money on the shares. If Tesla skyrockets to 500 when you sold a 475 dollar call though you miss out on that 25 dollars because you have to sell at 475.  Oh and by the way, in order to sell a cash covered call you have to own 100 stocks of that company. For Tesla that is 40,500 dollars.ÿg8s8sjp

I've never seen this sort of promoter score for an insurance company before, so I'm just trying to reconcile which of the three factors they are using. From what I can tell, it seems that they are improving on all 3, with the possible note that customer service is substantially easier for many things but slightly harder for more complex things.

Brain-Fiddlerÿserbiancringeÿ2020-10-14 10:12:33ÿDa, tehnologija je napredovala i u otvorenom globalističkom ekonomskom sistemu svi ti jugoslovenski proizvodi i fabrike nisu mogli da ostanu konkurentni svetskim firmama koje su nudile inovativnije, jeftinije i naprednije proizvode od starojugoslovenskih kada su prodrle balkansko i srpsko tržište. Zato su te naše firme i propale i rasprodate za budzašto.   Ima i dan-danas kompanija iz stare Juge koje su opstale i uspešno rade još, ali ne može naša Tesla da prismrdi Apple-u, Samsung-u ni po čemu kada je reč o mobilnim telefonima i elektronici. Ima još brdo primera, ali poenta je da nema gotovo nijedna lokalna firma koja ima realno dovoljno dobre proizvode kojima će dominirati makar i lokalno tržište a kamoli svetsko.   Tad smo živeli u dosta protekcionističkom ekonomskom sistemu pa su domaće firme dominirale naše tržište bez obzira na to koliko su bile inferiornije po kvalitetu proizvoda od inostranih (jer realno i tada je bilo boljih proizvoda na svetskom tržištu), a danas, kada je u kapitalističkom sistemu tržište otvoreno za konkurenciju bez obzira na geografsko poreklo, tu na vrh isplivava najčešće kombinacija najjeftinijih i najinovativnijih proizvoda pa otud danas naši voze “italijanske automobile, piju brazilsku kafu”, i “jedu francusko pecivo”.ÿg8s71hm
happyhappypeelpeelÿAskElectronicsÿ2020-10-14 10:12:17ÿ"I'll chime in - former Tesla senior design engineer.  Tesla - like most companies of that size - works directly with suppliers to develop, test, and support new materials. This goes for everything. Tapes, adhesives, epoxies, lubricants, etc.  Not as an ironclad rule, but about as often as not. It could be something off the shelf. It could just as likely be a custom formulation for Tesla which is not sold to anyone else. Even if you knew what it was called, the supplier wouldn't sell it to you.  As for the material itself, it's not a ""glue"" like you are thinking of. It's more of a crumbly foam, you can pull it apart with your hands easily. It provides mechanical support and acts as a flame retardant and an insulator (just in case). I don't know the actual name (and anyway I wouldn't be allowed to tell you if I did) but it is some sort of 2-part foam. If you google ""2 part electronics foam"" you'll find all kinds of options that will be suited to your task.  It resists water decently well, but it doesn't need to be hydrophobic because no sane design relies on the inter-cell potting to be its first defense waterproofing. That's not its purpose and I wouldn't expect it to waterproof the pack on its lonesome. And anyway if water gets into the pack then water between the cell cans is the last of your worries.  They *do* use epoxy to stick the batteries to the cooling channels (called bandoliers) before potting, which is an important thing for you to keep in mind for your pack. Batteries need a way to reject heat. If you just pot a lithium pack it is fairly likely it will overheat and potentially catch on fire."ÿg8s70ya
Sacron1143ÿhoukai3rdÿ2020-10-14 10:12:08ÿ"# Quantum Travels warning:  * This is what I call the events after Honkai Kingdoms Zero. ""Quantum Travels"" * While often nice to read, events that belong to Quantum Travels are often not important to the timeline itself, which is why they will just be glanced over. However, they often have interesting implications hidden in them when Captain is the topic. * **Cybernet Havens** is a global exclusive event, and thus it probably isn't canon. I'll still put it here, but you can ignore everything after Sanka Saga. * **Rosemary Floriography** can happen before, in between or after **Stygian Blooms** and **Sanka Saga** and there is no way to know which one is right with certainty. Unlike the previous events, in which the event order is either well-defined or doesn't matter at all, in this case the order is unclear and should matter. That is why I'm inclined to explain why I put it as the first:  1. In **Sanka Saga** Ferryman says ""*Luckily, when I was whining, someone told me there were people who needed me, and that I just needed to find them*"". Tesla Zero never told Captain to recruit the Valkyries, and Captain wasn't whining when Kongming gave him the list of ""Valkyrie Personas"". This leads me to believe that the person who told him that is most likely an experienced planes traveler, and the only one we know is Fallen Rosemary Rita. 2. In **Rosemary Floriography** Rita says ""*Though I may not be the same Rita you used to know, I wouldn't refuse if you ever feel like snuggling up to me*"". While it is quite a stretch, this could imply there are no other Ritas on board the Hyperion. 3. In **Stygian Blooms** Rita is the only crew member to not be a part of a flashback. That means she is the only one we know *nothing* from how her world was. 4. On the Diary from **Stygian Blooms** it was written ""*Those who jumped on my queue will...*"" and the Twin's and Rita's names are crossed in red.   * It is just as likely that Fallen Rosemary Rita is the same Rita from **Stygian Blooms** as it is that they are two different Ritas, but because of the above mentioned reasons I choose to believe that they are the same. This is *my i*nterpretation, and you don't have to believe it to be true. I myself don't fully believe in it."ÿg8s70nb

papriccapwnÿwallstreetbetsÿ2020-10-14 10:07:35ÿI think Tesla could hit 500 easily by eoy and that is a YUGE gain if you own share &gt;10 percent. You can lose a lot of value so quickly with options it’s crazy. I would expect to see an option holder see -30 percent in the price of their option multiple times until then. Seeing your account value drop by 1000 bucks is a little painful tbh. Especially when being well diversified in technology has been netting a lot of people up to 15 percent in one month while your position was getting hammered.   All that being said, Tesla is a more safe call option to buy. Fucking around with IPOs and pump and dumps like GME could net you huge returns but could also leave you feeling like a dufus when your option play crashes 70% when Tesla went up 5%.

mesaluÿFuturologyÿ2020-10-14 10:00:43ÿWell, I really wasn't planning on sounding like a Tesla shill today, but here goes.   Would you expect a Tesla to stop correctly at an intersection even if it had a drop of rain distorting one of its cameras? Systemically a normal road sign in such a state may not appear much different than one high up. Sure there are certain conditions you can check for, such as a box around the sign, apparent illumination around the sign, and so on. But like it or not there are certain things a driving system just cannot fuck with, road signage being one of them.  The more conditions you put around potentially ignoring signage, the more situations you enable the vehicle to choose the wrong thing in more normal contexts. There are ways to mitigate issues, such as wipers to keep optics functioning correctly, trying to detect other signage that indicates road work, and more. But it really all comes back to what is your source of truth? In the case of ambiguity, what must you choose?  It sees a stop sign, it knows that in all real situations that a stop sign is next to the road it is required to stop. It also knows there are situations where in the stop sign may appear large, or high, but it sees a stop sign that is in some way connected to the roadway it is currently on. It knows its on a highway, but also knows that it could have missed road work signage, or that such signage was not properly displayed. The situation is ambiguous, but it must adhere signage, otherwise everything falls apart.  I don't disagree, objectively to a human stopping is the wrong thing to do. But we have pattern recognition powerful enough to determine that the stop sign on the billboard was invalid and the wisdom to choose to ignore it (not to mention the piss poor perception to likely miss the sign altogether).  Maybe the developers at Tesla have made sufficient advances in their technology that they feel comfortable pushing out a fix for this issue. I really wouldn't be surprised if they deem it a non-issue though. Leaving a vector for an attack open would be silly though. I would also expect to see lobbying to get policy to help prevent the issue.ÿg8s6evo

syrvyxÿRealTeslaÿ2020-10-14 09:51:45ÿ&gt;You have me beat! I had 24 issues. Some pretty serious, like faulty modules and a broken taillight, and some pretty minor like broken trim pieces. My advice is try to fix as many as you can yourself and ignore the ones you can live with (I know, not something we should have to do with a car this expensive). A number of things Tesla tried to fix resulted in additional problems. The amount of broken or missing clips I have found from speedy repairs is amazing. They even snapped an electrical connector in half instead of simply unplugging it.  These people...  How Tesla finds so many people desperate to be fucked is unreal.  I'm almost certain Tesla could not have existed in a time before social media narcissism and when more people seemed to have standards and a spine.ÿg8s5xo4

He is rich because his family owns a stolen emerald mine in South Africa where they ruthlessly exploited workers pre and post Apartheid.   Oh and no Tesla isn't good for the environment on the whole. If he was just working on improving the engine system he bought out from others? Sure. But that's not what he is doing. The amount he has severely hampered Public Transportation products to sell his cars is ecologically and socially disastrous. His cars still use the same destructive and insanely polluting manufacturing methods as all the others; buying a well maintained used car has less effect on your carbon footprint by a huge margin than buying a new electric car.   SpaceX will NOT reinvigorate the space race. What it will do is normalize Corporate Space Explotation. There is almost no doomsday scenario as bad as corporations leading the way to new planets, I promise you. If you want to reinvigorate the Space Race you need to kill the hyperindividualistic mindset of Neoliberalism and shift hard out of the culture of anti-intellectualism. We won't get anywhere without long term thinking and scientific development that fosters communally beneficial programs.   All. Billionaires. Are. Evil. You know what you could do with $1 Billion that you couldn't do with $999 Million? Effectively nothing. You know what 10 random people could do with $100,000?

Or how about that he has 4x what the UN would have to spend to end world hunger and he doesn't.   He could solve innumerable problems at no meaningful cost to himself, same as so many billionaires.

TSS997ÿTeslaLoungeÿ2020-10-14 09:45:54ÿSeems like its one of those things which depends on your region and if there's already planned production heading that way when you order. So basically luck.

tmaxElectronicsÿElectricalEngineeringÿ2020-10-14 09:42:25ÿlegal is not the issue here I beleive. Tesla coils are actually a very poor rf-transmitter when making sparks, as the voltage actually stays relatively low. And as long as you don't burn down your (or someone else's :P) house you will probably be fine.  The financial part is more likely to be an issue (and the main one why not to build a coil). I'm currently building a 2m coil (overall length) and have easily spent 1.5k€ on it and it isn't even all I will have to spend. The tesla gun from Steve ward (pretty sure thats him) is a slightly more specialised tesla coil that (if I remember correctly) uses SiC mosfets instead of IGBTs, as they are more resilient to hard switching. And those aren't really available used yet (at least I haven't found any), and are those very expensive to buy; I got the SKM400 IGBTs in my bridge from a friend for 20€ each instead of the ~200€ list price, those SiC ones can really only be purchased new and are even more expensive then.ÿg8s5g8y

qlfangÿMVISÿ2020-10-14 09:41:22ÿInteresting comments from her highlighted below.  Maybe she knew that Tesla is also testing out LiDAR secretly?  On balance between imaging and lidar, the industry to a large extent ** (and I don't include Tesla’s own lidar trials!) ** has converged that delivering effective L2.5+ is difficult without lidar. There have been several industry white papers that address camera perception’s limitations in darkness, bad weather, dealing with low-contrast objects crossing the road, floaters such as tumbleweed, plastic bags, etc., and other unfamiliar objects on the road, tunnels, irregular lane markings, dawn/dusk/high dynamic range situations, etc. In general, the superior depth advantage of lidar manifests itself in so many real-world driving conditions that a brute-force approach to address every corner case either with camera-based perception or even with data aggregation becomes progressively difficult since the nature of corner cases is such that they have a very long tail (referring to Philip Koopman’s research).ÿg8s5ebf

oPerlezÿfo76ÿ2020-10-14 09:35:00ÿThe issue with hacked guns is, in order to truly remove them, they would need to change game engines. That’s how it all works without being easy to find and easily ban; hackers are using regular, in game guns with modding tools from Fallout 4, the backbone of this game, and just making a mod that the server, and Bethesda’s game code, can recognize because all pieces exist in the base game. Hence 50 cals with beam splitters.  My one concern is banning people in possession of the weapons. So many legacies, guns with base 3-star effects but the OP combinations, even guns with the tiniest of changes, like a recon scope on a Tesla gun, are dropped, traded, and sold in vendors to Joe Blow players all the damn time. I’d bet, if you buy ammo out of vendors, someone was selling duped ammo. If they start banning people for simply having the weapons and armor, when they may nit even realize they have it, is a recipe for a dead game.  Also, never buy Nuka Quantum out if a vendor. Notoriously the most duped aid item, primary used in PvP.ÿg8s52rd

They are well diversified across the board, a great management team at the wheel, consistently picking up new federal contracts, and they also have a solid dividend which has had no mention of being cut.   Will they perform as Apple or Tesla have? No. Will you see higher growth elsewhere? That’s more than likely. I think RTX is a good way to diversify outside of big tech, and with a few years time horizon, I’m not hugely worried about the short term bumps.

InquisitorszÿNecrontyrÿ2020-10-14 09:30:42ÿThey're all very different and it's nearly impossible to compare things like manoeuvrability and survivability.   The DDA is the toughest, having the most wounds and QS as well as a decent additional gun.    The Doomstalker is a very close second having 2 less wounds, save and toughness with a 4++ save but a worse secondary weapon and less range on the main gun.... but better stratagems an overwatch ability and is 50pts cheaper.    Both of those have to use the reduced profile if they move, so that's bad.    The flyer is the same defensively as the doomstalker but no invul save, -1 to hit and obviously more manoeuvrable. Also has a very good secondary gun (10 S7 Tesla shots)    The Heavy Destroyers only have 4W at T6 with a 3+ save... but they can potentially be brought back with reanimation (if in a unit) and they can be hidden inside regular destroyer units. They can also move and shoot without penalty.   So each option provides slightly different pros and cons. The Destoryers are the cheapest option and probably the best especially in smaller games where they can't be wiped out as easily.   The doom scythe has great damage output but it's fairly fragile.   The other two are pretty similar.    as with most things, stuff gets better when you buff it.   Various crypteks can provide various buffs. A technomancer with control node for example can sit up the back providing +1 to hit for 3 doomstalkers. Or a destroyer lord can give the lokhusts rerolls to wound etc...ÿg8s4ux4

happyhappypeelpeelÿFuturologyÿ2020-10-14 09:23:37ÿ"I guess from my POV I really don't see how you can argue it did the ""right"" thing when it clearly did the wrong thing in this example. Who decides what the right thing is? Tesla? They just get to say ""oh hey the car did the right thing"" when it parks itself on an interstate and causes an accident? It was clearly, objectively the wrong thing.    I don't think that's going to fly. Like, in society. And it shouldn't.  Also we are talking about billboards. Yes, if there is a monitor the same size as a real stop sign right by the road and flashes a photorealistic image of a stop sign, then OK, I grant the car a minor exception. Billboards OTOH are like...way up there, and they're huge. If the car has no or poor depth perception and can't tell the difference then that's a car problem, not a billboard problem. Tesla would surely like you to believe that literally any and everything that goes wrong is someone else's fault, but we as a society are hopefully smarter than that.   In any case, yes it's true that if nobody ever did bad things because those bad things were illegal, then nothing bad would ever happen. Which would be nice if it were that easy, because we wouldn't need passwords or secure connections for any of our emails, accounts, etc. What a world that would be, but we don't live there."ÿg8s4hup

You would think it wouldn't make that much of a difference, but somehow by not having to actively go faster, slow down, stop, go again, you achieve a bit of distance from the situation and it's not as bothersome.  Note: you still have to pay attention and be ready to take over at any moment.ÿg8s2jm8

mariano3113ÿUbiquitiÿ2020-10-14 08:41:44ÿ"The ending of support and future direction of products with Ubiquiti is reminding me of Apple/Tesla where certain staple features are being removed as they no longer fit the future direction of the company.  UNMS Router Pro with Bluetooth instead of Console Port when aimed at WISP, seems like a miss for target.  Similar to the newer low-end switches that seem to be there for branding in the same line even though they are unmanaged and thus won't show in the ""single pane of glass"" anyway.

The fact he had a new product lined up is pretty irrelevant.   Tesla/space X aren’t going anywhere but up. Selling stock in either because he smoked weed one time on a podcast is monumentally stupid.

AlbionAirÿtinnitusÿ2020-10-14 08:15:11ÿI got noise induced tinnitus about 7-8 months ago and at first I didn't believe it. That took me a few months. Then when it got worse, I was in shock, angry all the time. After a while it becomes annoying but still it doesn't go away.   There's a lot of good news though, the biggest being that the brain starts to tune out the noise as it establishes the ringing as a baseline. I think I'm sort of in that phase now.   I assume you also have hearing loss as that is quite common. If you get a hearing aid, it magnifies actual noise around you and thus makes the tinnitus less noticeable. And the newer hearing aids on the market basically hide in your ear so it isn't obvious that you have one unless you look closely. Last I checked, they go for less than $100 for a pair.   Also, Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla is spending loads of cash to fund projects via Neuralink. One of them is tinnitus. Whether he actually finds a cure is one thing, but it's just good to know there are famous and highly intelligent people out there working to cure tinnitus. The news exposure to it is, in and of itself, a good thing for the future eradication of this illness.  Introspectively, my tinnitus comes and goes, and sometimes even when it's there, there are good days and bad days. It's made me appreciate the good days more, and it makes it feel like the bad days are more bearable.ÿg8s12vx

mesaluÿFuturologyÿ2020-10-14 08:11:51ÿThis boils down, along with most things in the realm of self driving vehicles, which is worse. Seeing a stop sign briefly (maybe it was obscured behind some foliage or other vehicles, etc) and acting on it, or ignoring it because it was too brief and.  For tesla this is probably a pretty cut and dry case of adhere to the traffic sign. On one hand the worst case is plowing through construction workers or an intersection or something of the sort, endangering lives with out ethical recourse. On the other hand the worst case is that the guy behind you can't stop in time and the vehicle still has options to protect its occupants, while maintaining the ability to show that the vehicle did the right thing.  Really though, traffic signs on billboards should be prohibited anyways.ÿg8s0wwq

FascistSniffingDoggoÿpicsÿ2020-10-14 08:05:08ÿNo  https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/socialism  You're at a complete loss with the basics of leftist ideology.  I'm an anarchist, so I don't think we can have any meaningful conversation, because you don't have the ability to process a perspective outside of what was sanctioned in your school system.  I suggest you look more into left reddit to get an actual understanding on your political adversaries inherent beliefs before lying about their own economics at them.  At least know the basics, or most of your conversations with other leftists will be neutered, because they have to continually reteach you them.  Moving on... the government and capitalists are one in the same.  Take a look at the current cabinet of the US.  Most of which were formerly employed in industries that are antithetical to their current employed departments.  Ie. The head of the EPA was a former coal lobbyist.  Politicians are all owned by wall street, or they just are politicians themselves.    Both the Democrats and Conservatives (at best) are neoliberals, meaning they have an investment in maintaining the status quo for laissez-faire markets. They do this, because corporations pay them to.  What is the idealized government supposed to work for?  The people, right?  That's what we'd wish for, but it doesn't represent tbe people let alone work for them.  How can it when it's owned by corporate America?   A capitalistic economy necessitates inequality and the exploitation of the working class.  It needs people to be treated like shit in order to function, period.  It's why Tesla supports companies that use child miners to produce their batteries.  It's why you consume plastic particulates in every bite of food that you eat.  It's not either-or.  It's them working together to make infinitely increase dividends, but you eagerly lap their soles, because they present you with puppets as distractions.  They're poisoning our water and stealing and squandering the soil and finite resources that we were all born to inherit equally.  And you're still preoccupied with their government vs. corporations propaganda.  How is anyone still falling for that bs?  Do you have 0 life experience?  They debate about who is owned by what companies regularly.  They literally tell you they're owned themselves.  Climate change is literally an existential threat that's denying you the opportunity to provide a safe place to live for your hypothetical children and children's children.  All of this is a direct result of industrialization of the planet.  Please go and become more informed.  Please stop bootlicking the rich and powerful.  They don't want you.ÿg8s0krn

bitofrockÿelectricvehiclesÿ2020-10-14 08:00:05ÿA thing you must remember is that there's a huge difference between an established firm that has to return cash to investors consistently and a startup riddled with venture capital that is a bet on making it big. Much VC money is lost and can be horribly disruptive to established good firms even when the bets don't pay off.  I see it in software all the time. We actually have a problem in that one of our competitors is now massively funded. They're basically giving away their products. Past competitors have failed at a key stage, then we make a profit when the customers we lost start to come back. It's really disheartening and difficult because if we decided to take VC it could wipe out or long term company approach.  The trick is to let the VC firms burn thriugh capital and sit back and focus on your core strengths and then, once the market they're developing starts to mature, leap in with a differentiated product.  I like my little Honda ev. It's different to a Tesla and suits my needs better. Imtsure Honda will build more in time.ÿg8s0bjm

AquaGruntYuiÿdeadcellsÿ2020-10-14 07:56:45ÿ"No it didn't lmao.  Over the course of the patches since the Update of Plenty (including itself), items or tactics that were clearly out of line have been put back in line, items that needed some help got it, the economy was fixed so you can actually buy more than one thing on higher difficulties, and we've received new biomes at the start and end of a standard (non-5BC) run to vary up your gameplay some more. Some daring decisions were made (looking at you, Vampirism), Brutality got a second shield, the identity of each stat was reviewed, doubled down on, then expanded upon, and the focus on item power was moved from scrolls to levels to encourage players to improvise, adapt, and overcome with their build over the course of the game.  By nerfing the items that are too good and buffing the ones that aren't good enough, the options for one's build open up wildly. All three stats are in some of the best states they've ever been in because of this, at least in terms of diversity if not outright power (never forgetti double owl), the economy functions, and lower difficulties have admittedly become easier. That too is a good thing though, because it makes the game more accessible at an entry level, which makes it easier to sell, which equates to more money Motion Twin gets and can use to continue developing Dead Cells. I'd go so far as to say Dead Cells itself is in the best state it's ever been right now, though the Tesla Coil could do with a slap on the wrist.  Considering that the Update of Plenty - responsible for the bulk of the game's major systemic changes and maybe all of the minor ones that came after - was *three months ago*, and you're only venting about it now instead of when it actually happened, the only logical conclusion I can draw up is that it's not the game's fault you're suddenly getting your teeth kicked in at 5BC. You're likely just out of practice, and/or unfamiliar with what exactly the patch/es changed. Worst case scenario, you just no-brained your way through 0-4BC using the kind of shit that had to get nerfed (double owl, necromancy, so on and so forth), but I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt here in the name of good faith.  If you have to relearn, relearn. If you don't want to - assuming you're playing on Steam since I don't think the other platforms have Update of Plenty yet (correct me if I'm wrong) - play on the last patch that came before the Update of Plenty. The Legacy Update was released to allow you to do precisely that. If you don't want to relearn and are in fact *not* on Steam, then I don't really know what to tell you besides ""it's time to git gud again."""ÿg8s05b8

I give you my best example of how unretarded he actually is: TSLA goes up. He’s saying it’s oversold for about two months. Post split TSLA goes down 5%and he starts saying you should buy the dip. TSLA continues on going down.... he says nothing. TSLA starts going back up. Still nothing... now TSLA trades flat. Still nothing. I guess he will only talk again about it once, and if his last prediction somehow works out. And it goes back to the price where he said to “buy the dip” after shaming all of us for months. So yes, you can make money with Cramer, but it’s much better to make money with retards.ÿg8rzpjy
grmphlwarÿSquareInvestorsClubÿ2020-10-14 07:48:16ÿI have 10 shares of SHAK in an IRA. Bought it in 2017 after having a meal at the Baltimore location. Really enjoyed that burger. I have also read Danny Meyer’s book and found him very thoughtful in terms of crafting an experience for diners. I’ve kind of forgotten about the position because of my occupation with TSLA, but it’s done ok. Cost basis 37, so roughly 20%  compounded annually. I think they have an opportunity to expand locations cheaply.ÿg8rzpfs

entitled_gamerÿentertainmentÿ2020-10-14 07:39:06ÿ"Does that mean they must get a Macedonian Greek actress?  What's the rule now? That the actor needs to be at least partially descended from the same nationality as the character? How much would be enough? 10%? 25%? 100%?  I mean, clearly Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix aren't Roman or even Italian, so that wouldn't work at all in 2020. Except, it would work... because no one cares when you ""whateverwash"" Italian characters.  I'm asking this because I'm Slavic and our characters are often played by non-Slavic actors so that's a crime against humanity right there. No, wait... again it's not, because no one gives a fuck about us. That's why an English actor can play the Witcher or even Nikola Tesla!  But wait....then why are Brexiters ready to ruin their economy just to get rid of those dirty Polish immigrants? Didn't Hollywood tell them all white people are exactly the same?  Except when you get an Israeli actress playing a Greek character from Egypt. That's racism now! Wait, I'm confused... Greeks are European just like Poles, so anyone should be allowed to play them. That's Hollywood 2020 rules! Or are they considered black and non-European now, because on average they're a bit darker than Swedes?  Maybe Hollywood should just never make a historic movie ever again. Better to only film alien superheroes.

Actually, the reason I’m looking at an i3, is the fact that the battery is liquid cooled. This way, longer trips with multiple charging sessions are not an issue since the battery is kept at a decent operating temperature. Not many EVs have this (until more recent models) and Tesla has clearly shown that this was the right way to go. And Nissan demonstrated that passive cooling might not be the right way, but I digress 😄 Thanks!!ÿg8rybzs

AwesomeLowlanderÿfantasywritersÿ2020-10-14 07:17:25ÿThanks for taking the time to read, and even more so for taking the time to write that detailed feedback! I'll need a while to reflect on your advice, but I would like to clarify a couple points and seek your opinion (I'm not arguing, I just want to know more). I've only been writing for two months, and am still struggling to wield my tools well. Let me know if these points came across in the story, please.  The bolded font reflects Davenport being not-in-control of himself, he's essentially a megalomaniac when in that state. It's meant to be humorous, whenever he (or other sparks) are in that state, they view themselves as superior to everybody else in intellect and capability, when in reality they just have an enhanced mechanical ability and extremely diminished risk assessment. I tried to make normal-Dave and sparky-Dave have extremely different behaviour and speech patterns to reflect this.  I was mostly going for a lighthearted tone, with the occasional awesome bit. I'm not sure how to reflect that in my narrative, any suggestions?  The idea is that Dave is being persecuted simply for who he is and what he might do, not for anything specific that he's actually done. At least, that's how Dave sees it. I suppose I could have him wondering what sparked this mob when he hadn't done anything?  Re Tesla, he's basically worshipped as a divine being. I suppose part of the problem is that part of my plot is basically about Dave exploring history and how things came to be the way they are, which is why I'm keeping things back until he discovers the reason himself. And yes, it's a fantastical parallel Earth universe where Frankenstein did exist.  I do tend to forget to describe things as well as I should. I suppose that's a side effect of having aphantasia. I don't picture stuff, I just list descriptions down like a shopping list, and I occasionally forget to add things to that list. Going back to add it in now :P  Again, I really appreciate you taking the time to help. On that note, you forgot to mention one thing - would you keep reading this story? Honesty appreciated.ÿg8ry1uz

Bojarowÿelectricvehiclesÿ2020-10-14 07:15:58ÿ"  Renault has filed notice with the European Commission that it is accepting partners for an ""open"" emissions pool, an arrangement that allows automakers that are on track to meet tougher CO2 targets to combine their emissions with others that might be in danger of missing them, resulting in heavy fines.  Open pools that have already been formed include EV maker Tesla and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles; Volkswagen Group and the Chinese company SAIC, which sells the MG brand in Europe; and Toyota and Mazda.  The European Commission considers a pool as one manufacturer for the purpose of compliance with a specific CO2 emissions target. There are two types of pools: Closed pools are brands under one automotive group, while open pools have at least one outside member.  The financial details of all open pools are not known, but Tesla’s revenues from its FCA pool in Europe -- and a similar arrangement in the U.S. -- were $594 million in 2019, and $354 million in the first quarter of 2020 alone.     Renault is likely to be well under its emissions targets for 2020. It has Europe’s best-selling electric vehicle, the Zoe small hatchback, and this year introduced a number of electrified models, including plug-in hybrid versions of the Captur small SUV and Megane compact station wagon and hatchback, as well as a conventional hybrid version of the Clio small hatchback.   Full-electric vehicles such as the Zoe are eligible for EU ""supercredits,"" meaning that each sale is counted twice in 2020.   Nov. 18 deadline  In an update with the European Commission published on Friday, Renault said it was forming an open pool and accepting new members until Nov. 18. There are specific requirements, including the disclosure of CO2 emissions data to determine whether there is a risk the pool could miss its targets and providing documents showing the pool participant can cover to cost of any potential excess emissions premium.  One other open pool remains available. The London Electric Vehicle Company, owned by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group of China, is accepting applications until Oct. 31.  Volvo, which has a strong lineup of electrified models, said earlier this month that it would be open to forming an open pool, according to a report in the Financial Times.  Daimler, which holds a 1.5 percent share in Renault Group and collaborates on development and production, could potentially join Renault’s pool. Daimler CEO Ola Källenius has said meeting emissions targets in 2020-21 would be a ""challenge."" A media spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment.  Automakers that sell in Europe must meet a fleetwide CO2 average of 95 grams per km, with each company assigned a specific target based on the average mass of the vehicles they sell. Thus, companies with heavier vehicles such as Daimler have higher targets than those that primarily sell small cars, such as Renault.  The penalties for missing the EU's targets are severe. Fines are 95 euros per gram over the target, multiplied by the number of vehicles an automaker sells, so they could potentially reach into the billions."ÿg8rxyw2

bradleyaclarkeÿsonosÿ2020-10-14 07:02:46ÿhighly doubt this, apple just removed all Sonos products from its retail store about a week ago, looks like they're trying to really push they're product as a competitor, as apple home pods can be paired to an Apple TV. Also Sonos as a brand works with a lot of other brands, such as google voice assistance and Alexa, these products were sold with this support, if they suddenly removed these options and replaced it with Siri they could face lawsuits. Apple is the type of company who likes releasing new products every year or two, Sonos doesn't fit that mold, so while design wise and marketing wise Sonos is like apple with its ecosystem, it more like Tesla, were it releases a product and provides years of new features and easy upgradability and expandability. While marketing wise it would work, apple would just have to change to much to make it work, and that may take away what makes Sonos a lifestyle brand.ÿg8rx84d

hispaniaferÿHololiveÿ2020-10-14 06:54:14ÿ&gt; Oh, where to start! Firstly, his entire empire is built isn't just from him being some kind of genius inventor or investor or anything and is instead solidly funded - at first, at least - by his parents' literal blood money from a partial ownership of an emerald mine in apartheid-era Zambia. Additionally, he isn't really the founder of Tesla - instead, an investor that essentially purchased the right to call himself a founder when the company was in financial trouble, which I believe included a clause that prevented the actual founders from doing so (though I am not 100% certain on that part).  False. When he created zip2, he got private investment from multiple sources, with only 10% being from her father (less than 30k). The company later was sold for 300 million, being the first big money elon really got (20 million), with he used to create x.com (later paypal) [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip2)  And while is true that musk wasnt a directly founder of the company, he heavy invested in the company at the company 7 months after it was created, giving 6.5 millions of the 7.5 tesla raised in a funding round. I think is fair for someone to not considere elon a founder of tesla, but you need to give the full picture, not only the parts that make elon look bad. Also the rest of the founders are still considered funders, so he didnt prevent anyone from being called that [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.)  &gt; On a more broad scale, companies he owns/manages/etc. have histories of racial mistreatment of workers as well as generally lacking workers rights - including unfair hours/pay, illegally preventing them from organizing unions, dangerous working conditions, etc. As a matter of fact, he's been brought up several times in court against accusations of these things and found responsible, so it isn't /just/ hearsay from disgruntled employees.  While is true that if you work for a Musk company, you will probably end up working a lot of hours with a lot of presure. This take really exagerate it painting like some nightmare thing. The reality is that spacex and tesla are curently in the USA top 7 and 8 companys people want to work for most [source](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/10-companies-tech-employees-want-to-work-for-most-in-2020.html). Personally, I would recomend if you work for a musk company to change company after a few years to a less strick company, working for spacex or tesla is great for your resume and you can get stock of the companies as compensation, but at some point you probably will want more time for yourself  &gt; Thirdly - and on a much more personal, petty note - he's just, like, a super fucking annoying asshole know-it-all, when in reality he doesn't know shit about a lot of the bullshit he spews. Plus he's a billionaire, and there's ethical no way to achieve THAT much capital without abusing the workers along the way.  This seems to be really personal biased take. If this was a field were I didnt have knowledge, it would make me very doubt about the rest of the text being also biased. Yes, his takes on coronavirus were horrible, but when he sticks to her fields of knowledge like rockets or cars(that its most of the time on twitter), he is pretty educated in those issues  &gt;Plus he's a noted donor to Republican PACs, notably attempting to donate 40k in 2018  He has donated to the two parties, and even openly supported a democract dandidate.Still, I dont know whats the problem to support a political party as a individual if he isnt involving his companies  &gt;It's shit like that, plus stuff like the hairbrained scheme of sending a car to Mars (which failed, thank goodness) without decontaminating it and potentially ruining the entire study of Martian astrobiology  I dont know were you take this information of musk wanting to send a car to mars surface. There were some misleading headlines omitting that the objetive was going near mars, never to the surface of mars, for clickbait, maybe you got that information from one of those headlines? Elon still wants to put humans on mars, the same as nasa, but thats a different debate of what is more beneficial for humans, make humans a multiplanet specie or have more time to get more information of posible life on mars  &gt; To further tack on yet more reasons to hate him, u/Mistghost  pointed out that he threw a tantrum when his shitty submarine wasn't viable for saving the children stuck in the mine and called the rescue diver a pedophile While I agree it was a childish response of musk, most people omit that the rescue diver was the first to insult Musk. I think its only fair to give the full picture of the situation and not only the part were musk looks badÿg8rwq86

fyfy18ÿFuturologyÿ2020-10-14 06:53:07ÿAre you talking about installed cost or buying the panels themselves? In the US the main cost of installation is all the beuracracy that goes along with it.   Undecided had a good video on how Tesla Solar are trying to fix this and how they are the cheapest provider (yes Tesla is cheapest at something!) in the US:  https://youtu.be/a7MHaGeVrZA  Here in Europe I've seen adverts for 5kW installed with a grid-tied inverter for €3500. That may be with government incentives of €1500, but still €1/kW installed isn't bad. With my electricity prices, that would pay back in less than 7 years.   The panels themselves can be found for around €150 for a 350W panel (€0.42/kW) if you want to DIY.ÿg8rwntt

It showed that the way she understood the case was deeply flawed and she likely did not understand the real legal arguments that led to the ruling, because the reasoning she uses to justify her own decision on the ruling is simply not true.   It's like if you were trying to convince your parents and rich uncle to buy you a Tesla and your parents both said you weren't ready to have your own then your uncle told you that driving an electric would turn you gay.

Learn to draw support, resistance, trend lines, and the common chart patterns, watch and trade off those.  3. I said don’t base stops on P&amp;L of the options, but I don’t mean don’t use stops... place them off of the support and resistance lines in step 2! Short at resistance, close short at support... buy at support and close at resistance. Put your stops within a reasonable break of what line you thought would hold.  4. Size the fuck down... 1 or 2 contracts, or better yet trade something like NFLX, BA, TSLA, anything cheaper before you blow your account.  5. Don’t go hunting for a magic indicator be is bollinger bands, rsi, how far your cum shot the last time you jerked... just support and resistance and high probability patterns to give you an edge and let you know quickly if you’re wrong so you can get the fuck out.

On Fridays where there isn’t a general meeting, we host Friday Night Projects! Typically smaller DIY projects where we provide materials and some instructions and we either collaborate on a larger build or make something for students to take home! This week we’re making Magic Radios that can pick up frequencies from a wide variety of devices from fluorescent light bulbs to wall outlets to AM, FM, and XM radio waves!

xbox1playerÿconspiracytheoriesÿ2020-10-14 06:25:28ÿAgreed. Take the auto industry for example — they pay a “special tax” to the government that makes it ILLEGAL for automotive manufacturers to sell cars directly to the consumer. Here’s the kicker — dealerships &amp; the manufacturing of a auto company is completely separate, including the financing (Honda finance for example). They make stooopid money from each part or their business (manufacturing, dealership &amp; financing). If you could buy from the manufacturer directly, cars would be 3-5x cheaper.   Now look at Tesla (another rich company), sells cars directly to the consumers. A few years ago they came under fire about this because it’s illegal. I’m sure they paid the government off so they can continue to do what they do... their parent company even got a government contract out of the deal!

Aurhimÿfantasywritersÿ2020-10-14 06:11:49ÿ"*Disclaimer*: I'm very picky, I'm a mathematician, and I'm something of a literature snob, so keep that in mind when you read this! xD (In other words, apologies if I come across as especially harsh; I don't mean it, but, sometimes, it just happens.)  Rubik is cute, but Davenport is definitely in cringe-inducing territory for me, particularly with his **bold typeface** declarations in Chapter 2.  **Issue #1 - Tone**  This is something I have problems with; for me, it's the struggle to keep my inner silly-streak from romping through my writing and bashing and breaking all the delicate tonal atmosphere (heartfelt sentiment, horror &amp; dread, wonder, desolation, etc.) that I've spent time and effort constructing.  From the opening sentences of Chapter 1, I would have thought you were heading down a road paved in introspection, poesy, maybe some gothic (horror) elements, and the like. However, starting with Rubik and then with Davenport's disposition (more on that in a moment!), it became very clear to me that the tone of story was quite *unclear*.  Is this supposed to be moody and brooding? An art-house piece? Or is it meant to be a wise-cracking yarn filled with snark as far as the eye can see?   Case in point: the construction of Vanguard at the end of Chapter 2. What am I, the reader, supposed to be feeling in that moment? Is it supposed to be humorous? Wondrous? Uplifting? I honestly couldn't say.   Personally—though it might just be me—whenever someone starts saying things like:  &gt; ""Heretic! I am a spark, imbued with the Holy Spark of Tesla""   I inwardly cringe and groan—it's too over-the-top, even for me. That being said, there's a more significant problem in having Davenport make these kinds of pronouncements, especially given the other world-building issues in play: are these lines of dialogue meant to be campy (intentionally over-the-top, and humorous because of it?), or am I meant to take it seriously, and be impressed or awed by his devotion? It would be very helpful if you could straighten things out to make these distinctions more apparent. As it is, I feel like you're writing two different stories simultaneously as far as the tone is concerned: the more serious tone of the descriptive prose, and the more whack-a-mole cartoonish levity of the dialogue. They clash very strongly with one another, and you don't really go into sufficient depth in either to establish one or the other (or a mixture of the two) as the story's definitive tonal palette.  I also think your tendency to break your prose up into micro-fiction length scenes contributes to these two chapters' chaotic tone: you don't linger enough in your story's scenic moments to truly draw me in and get me invested.   **Issue #2 - Setting/World-Building**  With regard to world-building, my personal preference is to use buckets and ladles as opposed to teaspoons or tablespoons. I don't like being in the dark, not understand what is happening. The world-building in these two chapters is messy.  It wasn't until you mentioned Tesla by name that I had any clue that the story started in our world—but, even then, I'm still not sure that's the case. Was this the real world, or an alternate history version thereof? What time period does Davenport start out in? Modern day? Early 20th century? The distant future? It's not at all clear. Davenport's ""Saint Frankenstein"" remark only muddied the waters further. Victor Frankenstein was a fictional German nobleman created by writer Mary Shelly at the start of the 19th century. Thus, either Davenport is invoking a person he knows to be fictional (which, tone-wise, would suggest snarkiness) or this is a version of reality where Frankenstein was a real person (which would suggest a more fantastical version of our world).   Part of me is complaining because I just want to know as much as I can about story settings (and that's a personal preference, I know), but there is a bigger reason at work here. Davenport was clearly in what was supposed to be an emotional difficult, stressful position in the opening of Chapter 1 (fear of being lynched, etc.). Moreover, this stress came from a conflict between Davenport (his interests and pursuits) and... whatever was going on with society at large. By not doing a more thorough job of establishing the rules of the setting of the story's opening scene (and of Davenport's relation to it), you make it very difficult for me to relate to him and appreciate his circumstances for what they are.  For example, consider *The Golden Compass*, by Phillip Pullman. It, and the other two books in the *His Dark Materials* trilogy take place in an alternate version of our world, one in which the Catholic Church has basically succeeded in its quest for global domination. The opening chapters of that book make it very clear how the setting differs from our world, and how those differences affect the main character, Lyra:  • The Church is totalitarian, creating a society with rigid, stifling rules—exactly the kind to ruffle a young girl's feathers. Especially through her too-busy-to-care Lord Uncle Azriel.  • Human beings have shape-shifting spirit-companions (Daemons).  • Lyra can understand the mystical messages from the titular Golden Compass (the alethiometer).   Even though we don't get to learn why things are this way, or how they came to be this way (which is what I would like, because I'm a geek xD), we still are given plenty of information, enough to understand and appreciate how our main character is at odds with her surroundings, and what potential aspects of those surroundings could lead to conflict or intrigue.  To that end, here are some questions which I feel you should figure out how to answer in your story's opening chapters, so as to place your readers on more stable footing:  (1) What has Davenport done and/or what is he doing that so antagonizes his community? Be specific, and be evocative. (Did he invent a new kind of radio that causes those who hear it to gradually become flesh-eating zombies? Did his experimental rocket accidentally crash into a plane by the airport, killing everyone on board? Did he invent an air freshener that turns people into pomegranate trees? Is he digging up graves to make golems out of the bodies of the dead? Etc.) That is, *show* us Davenport getting people angry at him, and—by and by—use that as an opportunity to show off his place of origin, so that we can see and appreciate how (if at all) it might differ from our reality.  (2) While I definitely appreciate and encourage people to praise stuff in the name of Tesla, that particular behavioral quirk is quirky enough that methinks it requires some extra explanation. Why Tesla, in particular? Why does Davenport revere him so, and when and how did it start? Did Tesla himself help Davenport with his first-ever science experiment? Did Davenport spend time during physical education hiding away in some dark, musty corner, reading a biography on Tesla on his iPhone or Kindle? Etc. (Note how both my examples also serve to establish the setting: if Tesla himself interacted with Davenport, that automatically places the story somewhere in the 1880s - 1920s; if it happens to occur in the British States of America, that would convey that it happens in an alternate universe; on the other hand, reading something on an iPhone during gym class conveys a modern-day setting.)  Finally, on a personal note, someone who lives and breathes wonder-inducing scenes, I was muchly disappointed by your lack of descriptions of the ""flying machines"" Davenport finds in Chapter 2. Aside from being a great visual moment, that would have been the perfect opportunity to sneak in some world-building about the setting to which Davenport has been transported. Are they pedal-powered contraptions with cloth wings strung across wide wooden frames? Are they tubular, metallic chassis—maybe aluminum?—topped with quadruple-bladed propellors? Are they airships held aloft by great, gas filled balloons, with frames of glass and steel and wings like a butterfly's?  Give me more of the feeling that animated lines like: &gt; filled with visions of dragons entwining strange moons   Don't just tell us what's there—especially via Davenport's dialogue!—*show* us, and let us *revel* in it. Well, let *me* revel in it, because that's the sort of thing I like to do. :3  Anyhow, keep on truckin'. Keep up the good work. :D"ÿg8ru6h1

psaux_grepÿelectricvehiclesÿ2020-10-14 06:08:42ÿEV does obsolete so many ICE innovations though.   As Jay Leno commented on when he showed his 1930 Duesenberg, “Engineers have known about the advantages of things like four valves per head and hemispherical designs almost since they started making internal combustion engines. It’s just that the materials and technology hadn’t caught up” (free from memory, but that was the gist of it).   Things you don’t find on EV’s variable valve trains, valve trains, turbos (don’t tell Porsche), superchargers, exhaust gas recirculation systems, positive crankcase ventilation, fuel injection (mechanical nor electronic), auxiliary heaters (eg. webasto), direct injection, cylinder deactivation technology, variable intakes, hugely complex gearboxes, lambda sensors, mass airflow sensors, knock sensors, etc. The list is huge and I’m barely scratching the surface.   EV’s are definitely complex in their own right, but there’s very little moving parts that wear out. Sure, a Tesla has a few thousand battery cells, but ideally that shouldn’t matter over the lifetime of the car.   I think the biggest drawbacks of electric cars is that they’re quite digital. They either work or they don’t work. An ICE car will often let you drive it in a degraded state. The EV would just say “this is it”.ÿg8rtzpe

PDXSCARGuyÿAirForceÿ2020-10-14 06:05:46ÿYou don't want advice about running shoes from Reddit.  You want to find a running store near you, and have them help you out with your options. Me? I wear Asics, I love Asics... your feet may not.  Case in point, everyone in my run group loved their Hokas... So went out and got a pair. They were literally the worst shoes I ever ran in.  Nothing can fuck over a 12mi run like running in a bad shoe.  But because I bought them from a local store, I took them back and got another pair of Asics.  That's why you buy from a specialty store, the after sale support.   Compression shorts are a dime a dozen, tho.  I love the Tesla brand.  You can pick them up for $10 and they're going to last a good while.  Also, get a Garmin running watch.  They're the benchmark for running watches. The battery in them will last you at least a week or daily runs, and you can hook it up to a Strava account for better metrics.ÿg8rtt3u

Tesla was a proponent of AC power, while Edison was a proponent of DC power. AC ultimately went on to become the standard and is often associated with Tesla, though he didn't invent it and he wasn't the only proponent.

And if it is not able to last a million miles of wear but the battery can, why don’t we spend half of that for grid storage? Less waste  But let’s say worse case, there’s huge red tape. Tesla owners can at minimum utilize their own cars for power with a relay for peak hours, reducing load. If tesla really does make 20 million cars a year and take 50% market share, that’s like reducing power usage  during peak times by 50% (huge assumption)  A realistic case would be any net metering based solar connection is already grid tied just treat your v2g like a solar panel that works at night, they both send electricity back to the grid except one sends electricity back at peak rates vs non peak ratesÿg8rrfgm

What I can tell you is most older cars before 1985 that were drive by cable with a carburetor would buck when the RPMs were low and would be hard to stall.   These newer fuel injected cars with drive by wire can be computer programmed to do all sorts of things if the computer detects a rough idle or a stall including giving it some gas or cutting out gracefully.  Another thing with the 2103 VW CC was that it was programmed to have nearly no engine breaking and was a horrible experience to drive.  It also was programmed to have rev hang between gears.    Boy did I hate that car.   Was my 8th car with a manual and no car ever was so   Miserable to drive.   Most Manual transmission cars that are made today drive really bad thanks to the crap they have done with the drive by wire systems to help with emissions.   I hate automatics because they shift at silly times but there is an answer to my issues.   Electric.  Tesla for example does not have a transmission and only had one gear.  That works for me and will get an electric car in the future some time.ÿg8rr8nu

c5corvetteÿteslainvestorsclubÿ2020-10-14 05:15:52ÿ&gt;zero cost storage  It's definitely not zero cost storage. The battery is the most expensive and important part of a BEV, and the extra wear cycles means faster degradation, lower range expectancy, and higher warranty costs for Tesla. On top of that, it'd eat into their powerwall product sales.  On top of all that, there's a lot of red tape involved getting a solar system tied to the grid, so I imagine there'd be a similar problem for V2G.  It's one of those ideas that sounds great on paper until you actually think about the implementation. It certainly isn't a bad idea and may be more viable in certain areas or specific use cases.ÿg8rqh43

SaneLadÿBitcoinÿ2020-10-14 05:15:25ÿSo what? That's literally how _every_ asset works. Do you think people _invested_ 416.19B in Tesla, as in on average each American took $1,000 and bought TSLA shares with it? No.  If we really get to a point where most people have a bit of BTC in their portfolio, just like most people have a bit of gold in their portfolio, Bitcoin's liquidity will naturally be higher, and volatility will decrease.  But liquidity is actually irrelevant to the core argument. If we assume that people have 5% of their portfolio allocated to Bitcoin, than obviously these 5% refer to the *current value* of these Bitcoin, not their cost basis.  tl,dr; you are talking about cost basis. Got it. But allocation typically refers to current value, not cost basis.ÿg8rqg02

livinthedreamzÿflyingÿ2020-10-14 05:09:42ÿYou realize that you are a bit out of touch with reality and your arrogance is showing. A manual transmission, Uber, Lyft and your other examples are not a European invention, rather and American one.   Not that I give s shit, but your condescending tone as to why Americans do not drive is inaccurate. Kids drive less today  simply because a larger % of the US population lives in a city where parking is expensive, alternative forms of transportation are plentiful and this has basically removed the need to rely upon a vehicle which is an expensive item to have sitting unused for 95% of the day.   From my experience driving in France, Monaco and Italy, the cars are stick shift not because their drivers are better, but because the cars are underpowered and the stick shifts consume less energy and yield a greater MPG over an automatic transmission. A generalization would to be that Europeans are cheap and their governments screw them over with regards to energy cost which results in everyone having an under powered vehicle.   A non generalization is that this is why Tesla is kicking everyone’s ass in Europe as the cars have BALLS and qualify for the restrictive energy consumption laws that have been passed.ÿg8rq1ly

pblolÿABoringDystopiaÿ2020-10-14 04:52:16ÿ"People don't go to the grocery store every day. They go when they get paid if they're living paycheck to paycheck. Over time you accumulate these staples if you give half a shit about cooking. It's not a Tesla you buy all at once and save on gas over the years. It's more like if you could finance a Tesla for 0% interest and have near immediate benefits.  I completely understand if someone is working 60+ hours and time is the limiting factor. When I started grad school I was essentially making minimum wage and on food stamps. I could still cook a decent meal almost every night. I just don't really think money is likely the limiting factor in *most* people choosing to eat garbage. If I didn't cook, most people I've dated would eat takeout and garbage. I've lived with someone that ate tuna and frozen white castle every day while making good money.  I really do think garbage food tastes ""good enough"" for a lot of people. Cooking isn't worth the effort to make something they think tastes marginally better. Money be damned. A lot of people just don't know how to cook or have any desire to learn."ÿg8rosiw

Are you saying it took 14 years of development for GM to emerge as one of the leaders in the EV market?    GMs focus was much more on ICE cars than EV for a long time after EV1.  Just because EV1 was a compliance car doesn’t mean they weren’t developing something along the way- but they sure weren’t dead-set on owning the EV space.  Sure, they got some cars to market before Tesla, but market cap of the two companies doesn’t make me feel like GM is beating them handily at this point.  If GM really wanted to innovate they probably could have taken what they learned from EV1 and had models like Volt and Bolt to market a full five years earlier.  I’m no expert, and yes I made that number up.  But 14 years for the Volt isn’t because they were super busy solving a ton of engineering problems as quickly as they could.    For me, the Bolt is the true sign of GM getting serious about EVs.  They just took their sweet time since 1996 to get around to it.ÿg8rokeu

At its base pytorch closely mirrors numpy which makes it  familiar to many scientific users. It seems to be adopted by many companies as the choice going forward ex. Tesla, nvidia, and openai, as well as in academia. The  design makes it simpler to debug but may be harder for those writing training loops for the first time.

spectre138ÿGangstalkingÿ2020-10-14 04:36:19ÿ"Loosh is THE biggest topic in the history of mankind EVER because that's all we humans and our pets emit with each thought 24-7-365 from time immemorial. That's why loosh is all the ancients talked about and in fact carved in stone. And sitting down, loosh is why you and I are here. And you probably don't even know what loosh is. This sleepy apathy is exactly what the Archon plan and work for. It's why they have you chasing money, wealth, and have you distracted by many things. And you lap it up with smiles on your faces. You've bought into ALL the bait they set up EVERYWHERE. As just one example, they forced us to sit in a chair for 12 years... 12 years of the most productive part of our lives no less ... and when we graduate we are proud SMH and society responds by rewarding us with more indoctrination and car-rears and we think all that is important when it's just one long gravy train of nonsense, meaningless distraction after meaningless distraction, clack clack clack as the train goes rollin' down the track. Jay Leno's writers put it best: we're meaningless worker drones; our lives expiring in him with pointless activity.   I've spent a lot of time learning my way up to this ancient occult knowledge. Being gangstalked was the catalyst for all this which turned into the paranormal/supernatural. Oooh if you all only knew the things I've experienced. But I'm no smarter than the next guy. Just more priority-conscious to where I put my focus... in my case, more important gainful directions. And that's the big secret. FOCUS on LOFTY directions. The second I learned about loosh, I devoted every hour fully determined to seize giving away my life to these invisible farces.  PRIORITIES PEOPLE  The Archon - So much in life comes down to them.   All concerns pale. Chemtrails pale. The New World Order pales.   EVERYTHING pales until WE (not me or you alone) get off our collective asses.  And IF (not when) IF we can and do find a key of deleting these filthy mindfucks out, we've found THE key to this life, bar none. THE key.  I think this is why Fiona Broome, as myself, after she caught wind of the Mandela Effect, she still trudged on with demonology. THAT'S saying something. The biggest awakening factor in life is that this is all just a dream even pales to the Archon!  And THIS is the REAL fountain of youth to longevity and a rockin' good timeline - lesser-mind-man-ipulated conscious experienced reality.   By defeating these mind-masters, you can instantly launch yourself into far better, healthier, freer timelines. You're basically a free spirit at that point when compared to this lousy mind trap existence.  Until then, the best thing you can do is shamanic ways to lessen the damage and work at being strong and making your mind stronger than the shitty roads ahead rather than just melting like a snowflake in hot shit.  The fact that it's unheeded and in fact laughed off is a sad reflection of modern day humanity as a whole but at least I tried. There's not much hope for humanity when they laugh at the very advice they need most. I digress.  I didn't become stupid learning all I know today, but rather, the opposite is truth, that the rest of society is what is stupid - where I was too. But then we've learned everything from a false foundation, backward and inside out from the true way things really are from day one - the ACTUALITY BEHIND this fake reality. Truth is that THIS is the dream where dreaming is a step in the direction to truly what's actually real - not the other way around. The reality is the actuality behind this dream. Li'f'e is a dream not to learn from - but it is to be analyzed from a how did we get here approach - from that proper perspective and not the inversion of that foundation from the skull (building filled with empty-headed unthinking people) and lience approach.  And the more people laugh at me and my in-sight, the more I know I'm on the right path. The narrow way. So narrow a path that the only footprints you see are your own. The same thing happened to Jesus and other greats like Tesla, ""They will all laugh at you"" to borrow a movie line. I don't care frankly as I've outgrown the laughs and stupidity years ago. I mean how can a lesser intimidate you let alone you let them?  The Priority Of Priorities. LiFe is getting the crap out,the real crap - the inner stuff. Some serious major inner spring cleaning is past due. You gotta put Cardi B and playing violins on the back burners for once shleeple. It's better for you to wake up from your archontic induced nightmare paraded around like a dream which you consider real and even blissful. That joke is truly on you, and the fact that you are unaware of this makes that joke bigger, congratulations. But let's stop the blaming each other and on to life-long solutions."ÿg8rnk4q

odd84ÿelectricvehiclesÿ2020-10-14 04:29:28ÿ"Yes, EV-1 was a compliance car, built to learn about manufacturing and supporting EVs and the challenges consumers would face owning them, to ensure GM's future success in a world with vehicle emissions mandates. There's no other reason you'd spend $200K a car making them to lease them out at rates as if they were $30K cars, or to have the owners bring them all in for multiple battery technology swaps at no cost to them. As a compliance car, it was not intended to be ""successful"" the way you're thinking of the term, or to be leased out any longer than it took to meet the program's goals. These learnings lead to scrapping inductive charging for conductive charging, scrapping lead acid batteries as viable for consumer EVs, etc which shaped the future CARB mandates, standards, and GM being one of the first manufacturers to really get into EVs with the Spark EV, Volt and Bolt. Because of the EV-1 they had the first 200+ mile sub-$30K EV on the market, beating even Tesla to market. I think you missed the entire point of the EV-1, as it was a complete success when it came to the reasons it was made and leased out to those early adopters."ÿg8rn0ps

No other country can send multiple carrier fleets for several months outside of their own areas. I also define success by the ability of the US government sealing off entities or other countries from the US dollar system through sanctions can completely destroy another countries economy (see North Korea, Russia, Iran and Venezuela). No other country has that amount of soft power and economic might. We literally forced Japan to declare war on us by simply sanctioning them on oil and gas.  All the world organizations like the WTO, UN, and WHO were setup and serves the US. Although the US no longer completely dominates in this field (thanks Trump). The entire tech boom is thanks to the US and our tech startups are the ones literally trying to save the world - think Tesla and SpaceX; all of Europe can maybe take credit for Spotify collectively (lol). The only alternative these days to the world order is what... Authoritarian China? Does anyone really want to use Baidu or Alibaba over Google and Amazon in the rest of the world?

SippieCupÿteslamotorsÿ2020-10-14 03:58:20ÿ"Yes, but those inputs would all just get appended or updated into the unified input layer, and the rest is just optimizing around the model which is running. The point of this rewrite is that all the preprocessing is done once. The models can filter out the ""noise"" of those inputs which do not apply.  For example, speed limit sign detection takes only a small section of the 360* image, and doesn't care about ego, ultrasonics, radar, etc. Through training it'll simply dropout those inputs as unimportant to its task. However, because it doesn't have to run its on transformer or RCNN processing of an input image (since it is already done), the shared head of the model allows it to be far more efficient at its job.  The reason why not everyone is doing that (although most are or are moving in that direction) is because it makes training extremely hard to converge. Tesla seems to have figured that out through either brute force of hardware or some elegant training system."ÿg8rki6p

You have to decide your risk tolerance to decide what stocks to own. I don't really mess with Dividend stocks because they don't move in price enough, but thats also a good thing to those who want stock that has no volatility.   I only trade tesla, spy, apple and thats it, those are stocks in companies I know, stocks in companies I believe in, and with the exception of spy, they all have catalyst pretty often.

IntentsAndPurposesÿteslamotorsÿ2020-10-14 03:45:38ÿThat’s debatable as well. I’ve read stories on Reddit threads where people are replacing brakes in Model 3s and others way earlier. Especially in colder climates.   Regen is not available at high states of charge and when the car is cold. Basically a lot of the winter.   Couple that with the heavier car and brake wear is comparable or even sometimes worse than ICE. Couple that with the fact that it’s a Tesla and fun to drive fast, and you wear brakes fast. Some on threads have actually reported pretty rapid brake degradation on some models.   That said, Tesla maintenance is just brakes and tires. (Which also wear faster on Tesla, due to higher torque at the wheels and added weight) but it still is cheaper long term. Overall.   It’s just not nearly what you’re stating. You’re wrong. And literally anyone who’s owned a Tesla for more than 20,000 miles will agree with what I’m saying.   Promote the brand. But don’t promote untrue and anecdotal prophecy. It does no one any favors.   Tesla is not without fault. Overall, I think they are the best EV on the market by a landslide. I also think they are one of the best cars available period.   But tires and brakes cost just as much, if not more, owning a Tesla. That’s a fact. The maintenance savings comes in other places. Like engine, transmission, and misc repair in that regard. Not on the suspension or tires. There are literally posts in threads that are posted on Reddit in the last month showing total cost of ownership over a more realistic range. Such as 100,000 miles. The savings are there. But it’s not as gravy as you suggest, and completely contradict what you just said.   And in your video, you point out a warranty issue with the screen, which is unexpected. But servicing a car for brakes or tires at 20k, other than rotation (which you should have done already) is not likely.   That said, unless you rotated your tires yourself, there is maintenance cost you omitted. Or you were just negligent in your maintenance and misrepresented cost of ownership.   I’m not sure what your background or education is. But what you’re throwing down is not based on engineering or mechanics principals, nor is it based on a large number of threads written largely by fans of Tesla. In threads on Reddit or Tesla motors club. Both of which I frequent.  Your video makes you look foolish in that regard.ÿg8rjf65
BoilerButtSlutÿelectricvehiclesÿ2020-10-14 03:45:16ÿI'm personally very pessimistic that V2G will ever be anything more than a niche technology. The math just doesn't work out.  I'll use your numbers to explain why.  The first problem: No one is going to plug in their car to watch it drain from 100% to 0%. That's not a realistic use case. That's because a full drain every day is going to damage the battery, and it's because people don't plug in their car to drain it. They plug it to charge. So you're going to have lots of angry people if they need their car and it's dead because of this. At best, it's going to be more like 10%, but let's just assume 50% just to estimate. So really it's going to be 28k cars, or 35MWh with 14k cars. Either way you math is the same  Let's say 14k cars. OK, so a V2G charger + grid-tie inverter is let's say $2k to install (it will be more than this, but let's lowball it). So $28M to get those cars onto the grid.  So the utility would be paying $28M/35MWh = $800/kWh for this ability.  For comparison, the Tesla battery reserve in Australia was built for &lt;$600/kWh in 2017. It would be much cheaper today.  So if you're a utility, which would you pay for?  I can see V2H working since you won't need a grid-tie inverter and the costs are much lower. It's easily competitive with a backyard generator. But V2G costs just don't make sense.ÿg8rje0i

Hexi5ÿAskRedditÿ2020-10-14 03:40:38ÿThere are many but the most recent one was a 80 something year old and his wife. Earlier this year they asked me to sell out of their conservative portfolio on March 24th, the absolute bottom of the correction, because it was too much and they needed to protect their money. They didn’t reinvest until sometime in April at which point they already missed out on 10% returns on their particular portfolio.   Later in the year after Tesla split and after they watched some YouTube videos they asked me to put 40% of their investable net worth in Tesla, at its high. Previously they were only 30% or so in stocks.  When I brought up how the drop in their conservative portfolio was “too much” in March and that a massive concentration in Tesla puts them at a greater risk of the same result they say quietly and dumbfounded on the other side of the phone. They said simple “this was different” and proceeded to do it anyway. They’ve lost money on both trades.  I’ve walked through a lot of dumb ideas with clients but I have never witnessed someone so clearly mentally implode as these people did. The mental gymnastics they had to do to rationalize both decisions was astonishing and happened in such a short period that it really sticks out.ÿg8rizhs

kriptonicxÿstocksÿ2020-10-14 03:27:58ÿOnly problem is the current valuation already assumes that TSLA will be an extremely successful auto company and a successful energy company. TSLA would need to do even more than that if it wants to justify higher valuations.  So yeah, if everything goes perfect for the next decade then TSLAs current valuation would make sense, but it hasn't happened yet, and even if it does it's already priced in so there's no upside – at least, not in a rational market.  I love TSLA. I've been fan of Elon's for over a decade. TSLA was the first stock I ever brought back in 2011. But even I have no idea why people would invest in TSLA at the current valuation.ÿg8rhurx
PetiteQueenieÿConservativeÿ2020-10-14 03:27:23ÿStock doesn't translate to wealth for companies necessarily.  Anyone with robinhood can buy and sell stocks.  TSLA with such small marketshare dwarves any auto manufacturers who sell 10x th cars Tesla does.  But TSLA has Elon who is great at hyping and makes the stock a meme stock.  Hertz went bankrupt and people were still trading up the value of hertz causing artificially high prices just playing chicken to see who was left holding the bag before the top fell off.   I've heard of NYT having to lay off workers and lease a whole floor of it's office a while back (post election) because they were hemorrhaging money.ÿg8rhsz9
EVMadÿPowerwallÿ2020-10-14 03:27:23ÿSorry for coming back to this a week later but I'm still trying to get the virtual wall box working. I've set my car to charge at just 5A on 230V so the charge trigger is 1180W. I plugged in but stopped charging in the car and disabled the scheduled charging. I can see 2kW going to the grid because my powerwall 2 is at 100% so the trigger should be ample and the app shows it's up over 1.8kW available but it won't trigger even if I hit 'Start Charging' on the app. If I start the car charging from the tesla app then that just shows as power being pulled by the house and the virtual wall box always sits at 0 no matter how long I leave it. Weird.ÿg8rhsym

steinbringÿeGolfÿ2020-10-14 03:26:43ÿRoughly 6 months ago, I bought a 2016 e-Golf and it’s my one and only car.  I don’t regret it at all despite the fact that I only saw it over a FaceTime call before buying it, lost my plan-a and plan-b for charging, and only discovered after the fact that the VW dealer service centers won’t touch it with a 10ft pole.  I’ve owned a Ford Explorer, a Ford Mustang, and a Subaru Impreza (naturally aspirated) and it’s easily the most fun to drive car that I’ve owned.  You can smoke the tires all day long and it’s responsive as heck.  In the 6mo that I’ve owned it, I have replaced the starter button and one tire.  An electric car doesn’t have very many moving parts, so I’m not expecting it to cost anything in the long term.  Even the brake pads should last forever (because of regen braking).  My only issue was finding an independent shop with experience (see above comment about VW service centers).  I purposely bought one with under 25k miles because I figured that the risk would be minimal.  Based upon my calculations, I figured that it would be cash positive after 5yrs.  Anything above that would be cake.  I’ve talked with Tesla owners that bragged about putting 200k+ miles on their car.  If I got half of that in my e-Golf, I would be perfectly happy.  In case you are curious, plan-a for charging was the free charge point chargers at work but COVID is dragging on a bit more than I expected at the time.  Plan-b was the outdoor outlet next to where I park the car (I don’t have a garage).  Plan-c is a 100ft extension cord.  I only plug it in ~2x per week so meh?  I would go for it if I was you.ÿg8rhqtf

DeuceSevinÿTeslaModel3ÿ2020-10-14 03:22:27ÿOvernight my Tesla is in the garage and our other car is parked in the driveway. I went out for coffee that morning and when I cam home, even though it was not even raining yet, I remembered that it was suppsed to rain and get windy as tropical storm Isaias approached, so I decided to park in the garage.  That was about 9:00am. Meanwhile my daughter took the other car to work.   Around 10:00am a large branch fell off the tree - 3-4” in diameter.  Not enough to crush the car, but certainly enough to crack the class and dent the hood.  About 30 minutes later, another similar sized branch fell.  At this point, I was so thankful I didnt leave the car in the driveway as I might do on a normal weekday morning.   The trees within 10’ of the curb are the city’s responsibility in our town and this one had been shedding limbs for the past 5 years or so. My wife had complained several times to the tree commission to no avail. So around 10:30, she stepped out on to our balcony to take pictures of the two large limbs laying in our driveway.  She intended to send the pictures to the commission as further evidence as to why the tree should be removed.   As she was taking the pictures, the wind started to gust very strongly. She decided it would be prudent to move back into the house. As she was latching the door, looking out at the driveway, the entire tree came down. I was working in the other room and heard her scream, followed by a loud thud and the house shaking.   The tree fell right between my house and my neighbor’s house. If you had to pick a spot to drop the tree whilst doing the least amount of damage to both houses, you could not have done much better.  Nevertheless, as it came down, it took the power and cable TV with it. Also ripped my rain gutters off, broke an outside light, and did some minor damage to the stucco and shingles. But in the end no one was hurt, neither of my cars were totaled (they could have both been totaled under different circumstances) and now I don’t have to worry about the tree any more. My out-of-pocket for insurance deductible was well worth the peace of mind I have now, and if the wind if blowing more than 10 mph, the car goes in the garage.ÿg8rhd3y

paulp712ÿFuturologyÿ2020-10-14 03:11:56ÿOut of place nationalism? It is a fact that the first Nuclear reactor (developed by international scientists) was created in the USA. It is a fact that the first solar cells were created at Bell labs. I am not arguing that the USA is 'the best', I am using these examples to show that the US has been a big player in the solution to climate change.  Per capita numbers make sense when talking about certain things, but for climate change on a global scale we need to look at who is globally making the biggest impact. China has a much lower standard of living for it's average citizen than the US does, does this mean the solution to climate change is to have most of your population live in poverty?   Regardless of how you break it down [China represents 28% of world emissions and the US represents 15%](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/each-countrys-share-co2-emissions). Even if we reversed all our emissions China would have to step up to meet us. If they are doing so much better than us at this then why doesn't China use their vast wealth to invest in renewable energy sources instead of [opening more coal plants](carbonbrief.org/mapped-worlds-coal-power-plants) than any other nation by far.  In regards to your comment about Asian countries not needing longer range battery tech that is great for them. In the US, Canada, and any other places where people need to travel long distances day to day it is completely unreasonable to expect 150 mile range to cut it. That is what the cars could do before Tesla. There also weren't any EV options for shipping companies. Now there are. The reason people in the US haven't adopted EVs and broadly as the rest of the world is mainly because they cannot afford them and because in the US many workers have long commutes. This is projected to change very fast as the cars have come down in cost and have longer ranges.  The final argument I will put out here is that if all you look at are the politicians (primarily in the GOP) who are bought by oil lobby it is easy to come to the conclusion that the US is made up of a bunch of climate deniers. The reality is that most Americans despise these losers. Trump didn't get a popular vote in this country and Bush won by supreme court vote. Trump may have pulled out of the Paris accord, but Companies, local government leaders, and state leadership have kept their pledge to stay on track to meet the Paris accord despite the federal government failing to act.ÿg8rgf4w

bloody_yanks2ÿmetallurgyÿ2020-10-14 03:08:52ÿ&gt; The Tesla Cybertruck is made of much thicker and harder steel than most cars, which is why they're limited to simpler geometry.  That's not even really true, though. That vehicle has a monocoque hull, which limits your geometry options somewhat (because you're using the vehicle exterior for structural purposes), and it's true that cold rolled stainless isn't easy to stamp (economically), but to a large extent the Cybertruck is a design choice.ÿg8rg50b

EweVesperynÿTeslaLoungeÿ2020-10-14 03:04:03ÿProbably doesn’t help much, but I’ve been fighting this same battle with my 2019 X Performance. Significant front left axle vibration between 30 and 40 MPH under acceleration. Reducing ride height to low helps reduce, but not eliminate the issue.  I’ve been in twice to my local SCs. It’s a known issue that Tesla claims to have no know fix for. They will replace parts of the issue becomes too pronounced, but claim since the parts involved are the latest revision, it won’t permanently fix the issue.  Obviously very annoying as you don’t buy a Performance trim to drive sedately.  I don’t believe local service team fully understand the issue as the last one I spoke to strongly felt the X wasn’t engineered to handle the demands of ludicrous mode.  I’ve been living with the vibration for about 10K miles now and it’s about time to schedule another appointment for them to say it’s still not bad enough to warrant replacing the half shafts.ÿg8rfp4l
Adam-Smith1901ÿwhatcarshouldIbuyÿ2020-10-14 03:03:49ÿLexus GX if you REALLY want the car to last. They are EXTREMELY reliable so reliable they make other Toyotas seem unreliable by comparison. Also unlike Toyotas they aren't made here, they are made in Japan and IMPORTED hence their superior quality. The negatives of this car are it's a bit dated and the fuel economy is god awful but at least it won't be broken all the time. The RX is also a good choice if you want something with better fuel economy. The f150 is okay but will be more of headache than the two Lexis's out of warranty. Finally don't buy the Tesla, they have numerous build quality issues and are a nightmare to own out of warranty (almost as bad as BMWs)ÿg8rfocz

cobymobyÿHyliionÿ2020-10-14 02:54:55ÿPlayer 3 has entered the chat:  Carbon credits?  I cannot figure out if such a thing exists for class 8 trucks (semi trucks 80,000lb GVWR).  Tesla makes more money selling carbon credits to other auto manufacturers, than it does on selling cars.    Q2 - 2020   $104mm net profit on $6.04b total revenue.  Of that 6.04b, $428mm was from selling CO2 credits.  Presumably, the CO2 credits Tesla is selling is virtually 100% profit.  Without these credits, Telsa would still be losing money every quarter.  This is for cars.  I don't know if Hyliion is able to take advantage of such a thing within the commercial truck space.  Even if they could, I don't see how this is a sustainable way for Hyliion to make money.  While Tesla is using this currently, this isn't their business model for the long term.ÿg8reuka

First things first, I'm turning off ""send replies to my inbox"" and I won't be responding to anything here. You can call it whining, bitching, complaining, or tell me I'm being hypocrite, I don't really care anymore. Yes, this is relation to that fake account post yesterday. I'll get to that.  This sub is not about bodybuilding anymore. It's post after post of the same fake IFBB Pro bodybuilder accounts, most of whom aren't active on reddit. Sure, to an extent that's fine but only if that's going to be verified and/or original content. The side bar gets updated once or twice a year. The same stupid ass fake accounts post EVERY day. Hardly anything about what goes on promotes discussion about the sport. ""HURR HURR LOOK AT Kiera Jaston's BICEP"" or ""Regan Grime's ballsack is the goat"" or ""Look how grainy my picture on imgur is!"" How is that discussion? It's not. And god, the DD, 95% of y'all are the whiniest, laziest, people who look for excuses and shortcuts to everything rather than shutting the fuck up and shitposting yourselves. And for fucks sake, get over the girl and move on. It happens to literally everyone. Sack up. Maybe 10% of the content here is actually about bodybuilding and not these ""woe is me"" posts, a noob question, or something you can spend 5 minutes googling. It's ridiculous yet it's still allowed.  Now to the post. It is deleted now but it's absolutely ridiculous that they don't get automodded when they haven't been active here for YEARS. Yes, I did eventually get a response from the mods saying they weren't ignoring me and they have day jobs. First of all, 12+ hours for response isn't ignoring, fine. Secondly, day job? The post was at 6 or 7 PM MST, not to mention we're all sitting at home anyway. There are what? 10 of you? And not one of you was active? You want to respond to [u/DZ3015](https://www.reddit.com/u/DZ3015/) and say it's not a mod problem, it's a sub problem? Guess what? Sub problems ARE mod problems. You all have a responsibility to moderate and be somewhat active on here and you aren't doing it. Let's also mention this... How long did we let u/sandycockss, u/aaa19900, etc, litter the DD with great memes before we finally got them a brand new Tesla? Mod problem. Me, an active user, posting an unoriginal copypasta, which would have spurred plenty of discussion and sparked interest in real retards on this sub gets reposted but the 20th picture from a fake account just gets right up there...MOD PROBLEM. You hide behind the rules and quote them constantly but guess what? Rules can be changed. You can actively say ""hey you know what, some of this doesn't make sense and it's affecting the quality of the sub, we should fix some things."" Again, you have a responsibility as mods and if you aren't willing to take it seriously, then let others who care more take responsibility. And to be clear, I'm not asking to be one, I'm the fuck out of this sub.  To those of you I've given shit to and been hard on, you deserved it but tough love. I hope you learned something from it and I hope some of you have learned something from me. I made a post with the hope of starting to be more active here again because I do love this sport, I enjoy helping people if they're willing to do their part, and it's sad and disappointing to see how much this ""community"" has declined. If any of you need help, PM me and get me IG or something. I'm not going to be responding here, I'm not going to respond to PMs about this, I'm done."ÿg8rcl6h

Tesla has already deployed a real-time pricing software app that functions across its network of customers to sell wholesale electricity. Maybe some states will hold on for a bit, but in many jurisdictions that isn't true.   Either way, Tesla is going to mint money selling utility scale and home based storage systems. Nobody will put up with crappy expensive electricity for long when other jurisdictions are enjoying lower prices and better service.

nod51ÿelectricvehiclesÿ2020-10-14 02:18:30ÿ&gt; aside from Leaf bricks we're in shitty spot for salvage EV batteries currently.  I haven't tried to source other battery packs but Tesla S and X are also commonly reused. I think Leaf are nice because they are more resistant to heat but still degrade faster than batteries with active thermal management. Leaf packs are simpler that can be easier to tear down and turn into like 48v systems. I think with Tesla and others you would still want some cooling loop or those things can turn into popcorn. The Bolt uses pouch cell from what I can tell so should be able to make lower voltage systems if necessary.  &gt; I think I should be good with only 5-6kWh to start.  Depends on where you live and what your needs are. If you combine some solar (day) with a windmill (night) it may be cheaper than a huge battery and you don't even need enough for all night. If you can use your hot water when the sun is shining instead of late at night or early morning that may make things easier. Heat can be a large drain but a heat pump and never go below the minium (I think average around 15F/-9C) and you should be fine. Have a fireplace or gas as emergency heat and should have no problem.  Alternative: buy a Leaf 62kWh, split it ~10 ways with others, get 6kWh of batteries for $700, [4kW inverter/charger for $1.2k](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Inverter-Charger-240Vac-Output/dp/B07FPQ6XH9/) so for $2k and some wiring you have 1/2 a powerall storage that can output 1kW less. Things get a little cheaper if you don't need 240v and just 120v. Granted you have to enjoy learning all the details and make a cabinet for it and all that.ÿg8rbc14

But what they don't tell you, the fine print as it were, was that was based like your example, per serving. They don't sell dry pasta by the cup, they don't sell single artichoke hearts or 3 olives, they don't sell pinches of salt. Yes, each *serving* is only 2.50, but to buy those raw ingredients might cost five or even ten times that much. A bottle of olive oil might cost what, 5 dollars? That bottle will last dozens of meals, but if you don't have the upfront cost, then the point is entirely moot.   You just applied the Vimes ""boots"" theory of socioeconomic unfairness to meals. Those with more money can afford to live more frugally than those without,becaise they're able to put the money upfront in order to save money in the long run.

kassius79ÿModelYÿ2020-10-14 02:13:21ÿ"As a modelx owner (soon to be former; as I await my modelY) I can say there are practical benefits of those falcon wing doors that many people will argue are pointless and stupid. Being able to stand up as I place my kids in their baby seats without smashing my head on the roof is nice. At the same time I think they are too big of a hassle to mass produce to ever be on the Y. When you start getting into a $70K+ car as a manufacturer you can play around with some stuff because the profit margins are bigger.  Other things is the X has to stand out! That is what those falcon wings doors do. They are showstoppers, often drawing a crowd when I park my modelX and take my kids out. I've had so many people stop me to ask ""what car is that?"" Granted I live in the suburbs in Virginia, not Cali so modelX's aren't on every corner. The falcon wing doors are basically free advertising IMO for Tesla. I get why they designed the vechicle with them. BUT if you slap them on the modelY, it's just more one thing that makes the modelX less special and it needs to stand out more.  What I would like to see from the modelX and I know I won't are:  * A true winter package with a heated steering wheel (I wish they sold true winter packages).    * While we're on it cooling seals although they were there with S/X and then gone so I don't see them anywhere. * Air suspension. I don't use it but when I do I'm glad it's there. My parent's driveway is steep and I've used it multiple times.  Other benefits of the X that I may care about when I realize they're done but likely won't.  * Hitting a button on a fob to close all the doors. Helps if I come in with groceries, grab the kids and just hit that bottom to close it all.  That's it. I do agree Tesla could do a modelY upgrade package and I feel like the modelX when I got it had more upgrade options online at the time of purchase. I get it, they want to scale down the add-ons and smooth out the production kinks."ÿg8ratcb

You can do with with JNJ and MMM as well. So even though people on reddit prefer stocks like Tesla - that's overpriced and in a bubble.  For now, I'd rather take advantage of the moves in these type of stocks.ÿg8raed8
itsCosineÿunpopularopinionÿ2020-10-14 02:08:15ÿHe worked hard to get that 5 mil? Plus, these are completely different timelines. Elon sold PayPal, used the around 100 million to start SpaceX and Tesla, and they were doing okay, until SpaceX had 3 unsuccessful launches. Tesla wasn’t doing so hot either. He was left with a final 5 million, went all in and split the money between both, and almost filed bankruptcy. SpaceX’s 4th launch was successful, and Tesla started selling Roadsters left and right, and now they are both huge companies. The companies he bought with that money does not disregard the hard work he put in. Y’all clearly haven’t owned a business before, as just because you buy a company, doesn’t mean you are off the hook. He bought it for a reason, and has many multi-million companies to manage. Give the man some respect, and if you going to hate on someone, hate for good reason, not because you were ignorant enough to do a quick google search about the person or just because they are more successful than you.ÿg8raaog

The big  difference between google maps would be this would be live, including  pedestrians data as well.    You skipped over the triviality of how to work out which which pixels are pedestrians...  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; The car takes that info, compares it with its own, updates its own data  if need be, and figured out the fastest route to its destination.   ""fastest route to destination"" is a solved problem. It doesn't need cameras.  &gt;  \-The car also records the entire trip via dash cam or whatever. The  footage is uploaded to the cloud. -Future vehicles will automatically  access current and recent footage in real time. They should pick up on  road conditions and traffic patterns of the area over time as more and  more video is uploaded.   Doesn't need video.  Current GPS-based software can work out traffic conditions. And traffic conditions are almost entirely irrelevant for self-driving cars.  We know how to find the position of a car. We know how to analyze traffic. We know how to get from A to B for pretty much any two locations on the planet.  The only difficult part is how to not kill everybody if the car attempts to drive by itself.  &gt; I’ve seen a guy on YouTube using python train his bot to drive a car in GTA.    Did he use nothing but video? And even if, that would always be precisely rendered video of well-defined objects in an equally well-defined world.  &gt; So couldn’t you theoretically train an ai to watch footage and act as if it were driving?   For very useless values of ""theoretically"", yes.  (Don't get me wrong. Autonomous cars are trained with video data; but just because it can be done doesn't mean it's easy, or it will be finished quickly in a way that makes it usable on public roads. )  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;  Couldn’t you train it to pick up on how real humans drive like in day  to day settings or in abstract situations such as crowds, various  weather, and heavy traffic?   Yes. Except that none of that is as easy as GTA, and except that nobody cares how many NPCs die until your computer learns how to drive forward.  And - I think - except that how other people or cars typically behave is not the biggest issue in autonomous driving. A google car famously got stuck at an intersection, because nobody ever stopped at a stop sign. Everybody just slowed down a lot, and the AI patiently waited ... but that's literally just a funny anecdote and easily fixed.  ""Tesla doesn't classify image of big-ass truck blocking the road as a solid object and totals itself"" is an issue - and nothing in that situation had anything to do with typical driving."ÿg8ra2d0

Also, at least in sports cars, you tend to go to some lengths to minimize unsprung mass. I may be wrong but I would assume the same inertial considerations would exist here. I guess the question there is whether the mass of the batteries is even a meaningful factor compared to the wind-loads they are expected to take.  However, that is all long-term stuff. They are almost certainly not fabricating custom flaperon-shaped battery packs for possibly suicidal prototypes when they can just bolt some packs out of a Tesla on top and call it good.ÿg8r9fgr

nath1234ÿaustraliaÿ2020-10-14 01:53:50ÿ"&gt;You need to stop listening to 20th Century anti-nuclear narrative, they are masters of spin surpassing Shane Warne.  Perhaps if we were still in the 1970s the lines old lines you're trotting out about nuclear being worthwhile might make sense (and you are trotting the same lines out despite decades of progress meaning they are not relevant) - but it's only getting more expensive each and every year - and less and less competitive compared to renewables and storage which get cheaper every year.   I was a proponent for nuclear back some time ago, but I've learned that the argument for it has turned out to be bullshit by virtue of not actually being viable (e.g. the waste powered plants at any time! Or the idea that permanent storage problems will be solved. Or the economics since any time recently): still waiting for all those countries with mountains of nuclear waste to spin up those miracle plants that run off the waste (except that hasn't happened, even with the costs of waste storage ever upward..).   And the costs get even worse if you make it actually suitable for renewables rather than yet another dead weight slow-to-startup-slow-to-shut-down that will mean we need to throttle back renewable power to cater for the needs of the lumbering centralised slow response plants. We don't need that type of generation to go with renewables: it is fundamentally not suitable in the pursuit of green power in this day and age. It's also not a great option for a country with frequent drought and high temperatures (shit: the time we need the power in peak of summer is exactly when nuclear is most likely to be shut down due to temp/water scarcity). Not to mention it creates so many restrictions on where it can be put also that would conflict with the public desire to NOT have this in their backyard.  &gt; Storage is hardly proven.  We've had snowy hydro for how many years? Not to mention Tasmania. I think that's proven.  As for the Hornsdale battery reserve - what part of saving $116m in 2019 when it only cost $200m to build is not proven? Economically alone it's a pretty massive win in 1 year to save &gt;50% of the investment cost in dealing with peak needs, not to mention it can charge up when generation exceeds demand = win win win. It is a perfect mate with intermittent generation - it can fast dispatch in the blink of an eye (faster than the regulator even measures periods/responses) - far faster than nuclear can respond having no moving parts, no need to be retracting control rods and such. So by every measure it's a win: https://www.businessinsider.com.au/tesla-battery-south-australia-cost-state-savings-2018-10  &gt;Oh, and nuclear waste is the biggest non-issue ever used to terrify the world.  Nuclear is more than just expensive - it's uncapped TCO level expensive - they have, let me repeat: no permanent solution for the waste. That's despite major nuclear powers spending billions of dollars trying to solve it (US, UK alone have spent billions.. other than tossing the waste overboard at sea no one has ""solved"" the problem) and billions each and every year playing ""let's extend our temporary storage some more years"". To say it's a non-issue when it's an as yet never ending increasing cost of storage - how is that not relevant? I'm not talking safety concerns - purely the economic cost is a showstopper. The ""we'll let some future generation solve it"" thinking is precisely the madness that has led us to the crisis caused by fossil fuel expansion without any mechanisms to deal with the emissions. Other than a near-religious desire to promote the interests of the big energy companies wanting to transition from one dirty fuel to one that produces nuclear waste - why would anyone seriously be pursuing such an expensive and unsolved pollution problem.    For the cost of a Hinkley plant we could spin up a LOT of these $200m battery banks around the country to soak up excess renewable generation and not have a single point of failure... Plus we can more easily manage the tech - it requires electrical engineering knowhow rather than nuclear knowhow."ÿg8r8ron

keepthepaceÿFuturologyÿ2020-10-14 01:48:00ÿ&gt; look up where the first implementation of those technologies were tested. It was in the USA.  A very narrow criterion. You can choose to look where it was discovered, theorized, where it was first deployed, where it was deployed at the biggest scale, where current innovators are or where the biggest deployments are. Saying what counts is the first field testing is pretty arbitrary. But that's a moot point, I am just reacting to an out of place nationalism in a discussion that should be about practical policies.  Let's be clear, I am no fan of China politically, nor am I thinking USA is a pure evil empire (still go vote though). What I am seeing is that there are some clear problems **in the field of climate change mitigation**  in US policies and in US political culture that are not present in China. Most notably climate change denial.   &gt; Their emissions are rising while the US numbers are dropping.   China is still experiencing a huge economic growth yet its emissions are almost at a plateau now. It has announced it will peak before 2030. At a much lower level per capita than US ever was in the last 100 years. And yes, per capita, because that's how you compare efforts and policy. Human activity produces CO2, the more humans there are, the more CO2. We don't ask US to produce as little CO2 as Iceland.  Why are US emissions per capita 4 times the ones in France? 2 times higher than in EU? There are low hanging fruits that US governments refuse to grab, like emissions regulations on cars and industries, subsidizes for home insulation, etc...    &gt; Also one thing I think is important to note here is that the US is the main innovator right now in electric vehicles.  That's not really important unless you use that to lower emissions. And China is the main manufacturer and the main buyer of these. [EU comes second and US third](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/FOTW_Market_shares_EV_China_EU_US_2015_2019.png). US has also been, for decades, the main lobbyist *against* electric cars and carbon emission limitations. The main innovators in terms of batteries are in Asia. Tesla's batteries are Panasonic tech IIRC. Innovation, especially in 2020, has no border.   &gt; Before Tesla, 300 mile range was unheard of and it is crucial for trucking and long distance travelers to move away from gas cars.  Here again, a common and problematic assumption. Walk in Tokyo, in Shenzhen, many electric vehicles are doing deliveries or inner city trips. Deployment does not need to wait the ability to drive hundreds of miles in one go. Most urban people do not do that, not even once in a year.ÿg8r84el

OfficerCollinsÿstocksÿ2020-10-14 01:44:53ÿUS utilities have created a market where solar only benefits them. In most states you cannot take your house off the power grid because it legally becomes open to being classified as condemned because its not hooked up to utilities. The Utilities have lobbied hard to make sure that most Urban markets have condemnation laws for taking your house off the grid.  On top of this Utilities in a lot of the large sun exposure states have used lobbying to take away surplus refunds or made the refund value obscenely low. So if you put power back on the grid you no longer get paid for it or get paid practically nothing for it; but they get to redistribute it later for their same rate despite the power basically being given to them. If you have a large battery back up you can choose to charge it with surplus but if the backup is full you cannot choose to just dump the surplus, since grid connection is a legal requirement you have to give that surplus back to the utilities.  Yes you reduce your footprint but my point was I don't see tesla becoming an alternate utility ever. That's a pipe dream that they do not have the money to fight for. The utilities will be able to lobby for laws that favor solar infrastructure having to point back to their battery back ups rather than to an alternate provider. The further point of that was my example of how far california went to protect the utilities from being held liable for poor equipment maintenance after the PCG bankruptcy over those fires from 2017 and 2018. Its just a monumental uphill battle that I do not think tesla will take on. They have accomplished a lot in terms of changing lobbied regulation like the anti  direct to consumer laws for car sales in most states they have reversed but this situation is a class among its own.ÿg8r7s81

Tesla, NVTA, SQ, ROKU, crsp, prlb ...    Couple months ago I talked about how I made a mistake buying JPM instead of PTON. Difference between 5% return (1% div) and 100%+ it was $55 at the time.  So I sold JPM and bought SQ and SPT on Friday. Good to be up 2% and feel good about it. 5k bullets every week or so.

There is obviously something wrong with either your utilities (fridge) or the wiring is fucked up and your neighbor is charging their Tesla truck on your bill.   If your landlord does not act in 30 days, you might be able to call an electrician yourself and deduct the cost from rent (this applies to at least issues with plumbing, maybe also electric fixtures). The issue can of course be in the SDGE meter in which case you're out of luck wrt. the landlord but at least you would know for sure.

It is an economic system that inevitably promotes monopoly and oppression. You cannot choose to freely move if you cannot afford to do so. I do not think the workers in factory houses being paid with company script really had a choice what they could do with their lives.  &gt;Under capitalism you are free to trade with whomever you want to. Anyone is allowed to start any businesses and provide service to anyone.  Both false. I would go to prison if I traded with Iran, or provided illegal services. And being allowed to do something does not mean you are capable of doing so.  It is not illegal for me to become a CEO or a billionaire. It is functionally impossible.  &gt;If someone wants to break their back creating a corporate empire they can do so.   Chances are they will come from money though. Unjust hierarchies, baby!

cbierkÿteslamotorsÿ2020-10-14 01:14:20ÿModel Y back middle seatbelt alert working improperly  Hey there. Since taking delivery of my Model Y, the seatbelt alert constantly goes off for the back middle seat when it is down. When I swipe the alert away it continues to pop up, frustrating and potentially dangerous because I can’t access wiper control. Eventually, it will disappear only to pop up again when I go over a bump. Clearly, the car thinks the weight of the seat itself or the cargo being stored ontop of it is a person. My Tesla service center is trying to tell me that this is normal. This can’t be...right? Surly the car has sensors which tell the seatbelt sensor not to trigger when the seats are down? This doesn’t happen to either the back left or back right seat when they are down - even when they have heavy cargo ontop of them. Has anyone else experienced this issue or had it fixed? Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.ÿg8r4hep

quantumpencilÿwallstreetbetsÿ2020-10-14 01:06:33ÿ"This strategy isn't perfect. Low upside on premiums and if you don't use a credit/debit spread and you get exercised on potentially huge upside loss on the underlying. You may think ""oh, what's the worst that could happen, I get exercised on and then have to sell at a profit?""     No, you get exercised on and have to sell and potentially give the upside up on a big winner over an inconsequential premium. Even worse if you try selling puts, because when you get assigned at that price you thought the stock was never gonna hit... you might not want it any more (and you capital is locked up if you're covering... which you should be) &gt;\_&gt;.      Not to say there's no value in this strategy -- Wheeling can be good on low vol dividend stocks (I use it on MSFT and a few others), but why would you want to limit your upside on your growth allocation (which TSLA should be part of). A high volatility stock like tesla might smash through your strike on any random day.     Buying options is riskier, but has a much more favorable reward profile provided you don't buy out of the money weeklies before an event and just get manhandled by theta and IV crush every time.      Just:  Buy options at or slightly out of the money (a few strikes out)   Buy options with a long enough time horizon that you can manage the trades and not have them implode on you due to the greeks before you can react   Aim to resell your options in response to market movements or during the build up to events at a profit (or cut your losses early while they are manageable)   Manage your risk with a hedge/spread if you're going to take a big bet"ÿg8r3m9b

If you only intend to buy a battery and no solar panels then you'll be using the grid 100% of the time.

ShneekeyTheLostÿworldnewsÿ2020-10-14 00:57:19ÿAll well and good, and we do need more solar and wind in our grid-level energy production, but we simply don't have the manufacturing capacity to make that many solar panels in the next decade.   Solar panels don't sprout out of the ground like so many potatoes. It takes a lot of infrastructure, from raw materials to manufacturing to shipping, to make them. It doesn't exist. It doesn't even \*begin\* to exist. Our current solar panel manufacturing is probably around one percent of where it needs to be, and I'm being exceedingly generous in that.   Same thing with energy storage, which we also need, and can't make yet. Hell, even Tesla's plans for the next decade is going to be a drop in the bucket compared to what we will need. We'll need at least a dozen other companies doing exactly what Tesla is doing if we want to get anywhere with it. And no one has a fucking clue how to even begin doing it, other than Tesla.   And even then, it won't be enough. You'll need more than wind and solar. Nuclear will have to be part of the solution as well. Hydro is good, but is geographically limited and has substantial economic impact, upstream and downstream. Geothermal is even more geographically limited. Neither can scale well. So unless you want to resort to 'burning something that is going to release CO2 as part of the combustion process', Nuclear is going to have to be part of the equation as well.ÿg8r2kuc

XanthicStatueÿAskRedditÿ2020-10-14 00:53:11ÿOh man so many.   Client puts $300k into his brokerage account to buy stock. He calls us a few weeks later and his account is nearly at $0 and he’s asking what’s wrong. Turns out he bought deep OTM calls, not the stock. We asked him what he thought he was buying. He said he thought he was getting a good deal on the shares.   Plenty of people that caught the bitcoin FOMO when it was at its peak. One guy sold all $30k of his stocks and said he was investing in bitcoin. Tried to explain volatility, bubble risk, etc., but he wasn’t having it. Bitcoin crashed a few weeks later. Word of caution: if someone that knows absolutely nothing about investments and starts talking about a good investment idea - it is not.   Lots of real bad trades. People trying to short TSLA. Buying way too many contracts on volatile stocks. People not understanding assignment risk of selling options. People generally just having no clue about securities they are trading.ÿg8r2435

bread_on_treesÿTeslaLoungeÿ2020-10-14 00:40:10ÿThanks for posting this! I have VERY similar stats. I always thought my degradation was a bit high... I think we're both getting normal results.  Model 3 SR+  Purchased: March 2019  Range when new: 240 miles  **Displayed range at 100%: 214 miles**  Degradation: 10.8%  Daily charge to 80%  31,496 miles  271 wh/mi lifetime average (aero caps off and spirited driving)  Going from my daily charge of 80% down to 5%, I could get about 105 miles of practical driving distance if needed. This is with zero planning (didn't charge to 100% the night before, didn't put on my aeros, wasn't caring about speed/efficiency, etc)  On road trips: about 240 wh/mi. Aeros on, about 75mph. This means if I go from 100% down to 5% on a road trip, I can travel a maximum of 140-170 miles. It depends on elevation and temperature.  I've done a long road trip from Louisiana to Nevada (3394 miles round trip). I've done this trip twice and have trouble between Albuquerque, NM and Gallup, NM. Even waiting 50 minutes to supercharge up to 100% at Albuquerque, I always get to Gallup with like 1 or 2 miles of range left. Tesla really needs a supercharger in Grants, NM... Would save me time and reduce anxiety.  Tesla says SR+ is capped at 170kw for supercharging, but I only reach about 160kw briefly at the start. If I have to supercharge beyond 80%, it can take 40-50 minutes. The next tesla I get will be a 500 mile range cybertruck. I only plan to use the first half of the battery but REALLY want the faster charge speed ramp. Would be awesome to get like 200 miles of range in 15 minutes or so.ÿg8r0qcg

irishknightÿembeddedÿ2020-10-14 00:38:42ÿPurely anecdotal but generally, I have had the most success in getting positive, quicker responses from companies that used their own website/resources for job application submissions.  FYI, everyone and their dog tries to intern at Tesla and Apple. Now with COVID and economic downturn in the mixture, many of the available opportunities out there are infinitesimally small to none for internships since they typically do not produce immediate tangible value for the company. Try to look for embedded internships in medical device applications or other essential areas that are profiting well from this situation--e.g. Amazon, Zoom.   Keep grinding. Good luck.ÿg8r0kt1

ricktherickÿflyingÿ2020-10-14 00:32:54ÿI disagree. I think mass transit and other greener solutions are great, but that’s completely separate from the mechanical interest lots of us have in driving and flying. Why do fewer people in America care about driving manual transmissions, and why do fewer people have an interest in driving at all? I always loved a manual car because of the connection, but even I’ve gotten “lazy” about it and put my Tesla on autopilot now. If I didn’t have a plane, I think I’d still be into manual transmissions or motorcycles, or something more hands on. That desire seems to be waning in the younger generations, interests shift over time.ÿg8qzyu4

Had a person on r/teslamotors tell me that their VW's headlights burning out were a similar QC failure to the MY's roof falling off. It's unfortunate that people can't see obvious flaws but, again, the vast majority of Tesla owners are moderate middle-class people who want a convenient, fun EV to take them from A to B. The internet can make it seem like all Tesla owners are hardcore geek Elon's-ball-fondlers but that's really not the case.  Yes, I agree that it doesn't get worse than Tesla service. The company grew faster than they imagined and it seems like they forgot that they actually have to scale the Customer Service department to meet higher demand. I've only had good experiences so far but I know how terrible it can get.ÿg8qzg0q

fredinnoÿRealTeslaÿ2020-10-14 00:19:10ÿWait, so how are net institutional holding for shares negative? Does that mean shorting?  The WSJ and Business Insider says they did invest money into Tesla as well as call options.  Not 100% sure what call options are, but from what I can understand, they seem like some kind of insurance for the shares?  https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/softbank-invests-billions-tech-giants-stock-market-tesla-amazon-netflix-2020-8-1029513600#  https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbanks-bet-on-tech-giants-fueled-powerful-market-rally-11599232205?mod=hp_lead_pos2  Really though, SoftBank's investment is a drop compared to its overall investment in tech stocks ($3.9 billion) and Tesla's valuation overall (especially considering the run-up it may or may not have caused). They had way more invested in WeWork, this move is honestly pretty conservative and the least of their worries.ÿg8qyi0o

aklost33ÿstocksÿ2020-10-14 00:15:25ÿI lost money on call options as well, but you are just ranting. The company itself is actually the most viable Green Long Haul/Semi option out there right now. They will beat all their competitors in mass production and likely in sales. They are the only company that will offer converting vs. flat out purchasing a new truck. There are thousands of truckers out there that own ONE semi and it is their entire livelihood. They can’t afford to slap down money for a Tesla Truck or any full electric option if regulations change. They can however, likely afford to modify their existing truck at what Hyliion is charging. This is even more affordable when you consider they can save $15,000 a year in fuel costs. In less than three years they have saved enough in fuel costs to off set the costs.   Hyliion currently has more than 20 Hybrids on the road, accruing 2 million miles. They will be ready to roll out trucks as soon as 2021, beating Tesla by two years.   This company, unlike NKLA is legit. This company will make you eat your words in the next five years (especially if Dems wins big in the election). This isn’t some pump and dump. This is a great company that will change long haul trucking, for the better.   Hold. Long term. Ignore the guy crying over his lost calls.ÿg8qy3si

CanyonCoyoteÿbillsimmonsÿ2020-10-14 00:06:23ÿI don’t love the staff tweeting and being passive aggressive buuuutttt we are in the midst of a global pandemic with massive unemployment and their Bill just made 9 figures. He keeps hiring outside talent to helm the pods. The younger folks in addition to not seeing growth aren’t even getting the “perks” of working every day with other young folks.  It sounds like the staff is spread out across the country at this point, there is no community anymore. The nation has also changed drastically. People are catching wind of the insane levels of income inequality and rich people becoming insanely rich and hoarding money. These people are journalist types and paid to be on social media at a liberal company so they are already most likely pretty deep into the fury surrounding healthcare and income inequality. They are being paid reasonably but it’s tough to swallow that when your boss gets nine figures and you are sweating healthcare and your future. I remember being at a smaller production company and lower people on the totem pole definitely raised an eyebrow when the owner drove his third different Tesla in a week to the office while they were being paid below industry standard with no benefits because of their freelance status. Who knows maybe Bill gives everyone bonuses and they all shut up. But right now in the midst of a potential Trumptatorship and seeing Billionaires grow wealthier as unemployment balloons, people are gonna be pissed at their Simmonsesque bosses buying 20 million 4th houses while they get Chipotle for the fourth time in a week.ÿg8qx5s9

RooperStarsÿstocksÿ2020-10-14 00:04:20ÿ"Tesla have a business plan and income streams that provide diversity within the single stock.  for example Every battery advancement feeds their power business as well as their car business.  No-one else (of scale or real international relevance) can get two bangs for their buck like that.  Tesla's biggest asset that I don't hear anyone talking about but that is probably worth the current valuation alone is their data set on driving.  No other business comes within a solar system of matching the rate that Tesla does (or could flick a switch to achieve) harvest driving data in all conditions.  At some point every single other car maker is going to have to come cap-in-hand to Tesla and say ""We can make the cars, can you please drive them for us?""  If every car drove on the same algo there would be a negligible number of crashes.  Tesla could charge more for that service alone than Ford make on a manufactured car today.  So rather than having a slice of the market, Tesla could manufacture 5% or whatever of the cars but profit from 100% of them.  And I always ask this and never get a good response but I'll try again.  If BMW, AUDI, VW, Ford, Jaguar, Mercedes et al have been ripping you off buy deliberately creating obsolescence for decades now and have created dealership networks that rely on you needing to maintaining your car , A) why would you trust them to build you a reliable e-car now?  B) how do they extricate themselves from under the dealer expectations without murdering their stock prices?  Who going to continue to pay for a dealership when there's no recurring revenue and cars last for decades?  My assertion is that of the 20 or so major car marques you see on roads in the western world today (the list above above plus Mazda, Honda, Kia, Mitsubishi, Hyundai, GM, Chevvy, Toyota, Land Rover plus a few I can't think of now) there will be fewer than 3 left in 20 years.  They simply cannot make the shift.  Dead men driving!  Will Tesla be the only game in town?  No, certainly not, but these guys are NOT the ones who are coming after them.  It's Chinese competition or it's net new brands without legacy costs and old business models weighing them down."ÿg8qwxp1
thefinancethrowawayÿbayareaÿ2020-10-14 00:04:15ÿ"&gt; Sounds great if it would work. Reminds me of a story I was told as a kid. The boy that was given a bike never took care of it and eventually got stolen when left out.The boy that worked all summer to pay for his bike kept it in top shape and always kept it safe.  I could point out the inherent classism in this sentiment.  I could point out that it makes certain absolute assumptions about the unhoused population in the area that are simply not true.  I could even point out that this sentiment would, taken at it's face, apply equally well to any housed individuals in the area ""given"" their housing by virtue of inheritance or even tax breaks and rent control.  Instead, I'll just point out that this solution has been done, and your concern ended up not materializing.  People by and large took care of their housing, and prospered as a result.  In some cases, the individuals already could provide for themselves but were just a bit short of housing (something that a large portion of the unhoused population in the area identifies as; there are unhoused people in the bay with yearly incomes about the national poverty line). In some case, the housing provided a sufficiently strong foundation to enable them to being providing for themselves.   Yes, some individuals may still end up on the street.  This isn't a solution to fix 100% of the problem. No real world solution can fix 100% of any problem.  But ""some people won't appreciate it and may damage it"" and ""some people will just stay on the street anyway"" are not reasonable arguments against the concept as a whole. That's like insisting that since one Tesla' room blew off that all cars are unsafe."ÿg8qwxcg
cheddarbenÿstocksÿ2020-10-14 00:04:11ÿThe case is batteries.   That said, look at the actual revenue they make from batteries and the actual sales from home installs.   Could this be important for their future? Sure.  That said, I have yet to see a real case for what a financial statement five years from now might look like that would justify the current price.  Disclosure... I own TSLA, but only because I had a win shorting the market. As soon as TSLA hits $500, I intend on doing some more shorting. Or at least that is my plan at the moment. Why? Real value doesn't mean anything anymore and I am going to ride the lightning.ÿg8qwx4t

Renewables are now the lowest cost source of power.  https://www.lazard.com/media/451086/lazards-levelized-cost-of-energy-version-130-vf.pdf  Page 3  USD/MWh  Gas Peaker $140-$208  Nuclear $118-$192  Coal $66-$152  Gas combined cycle $44-$68  Solar $32-$42  Wind $28-$54  Goldman predicts renewables investment will exceed upstream O&amp;G in 2021.  https://www.businessinsider.com/renewable-energy-trillion-investment-opportunity-surpass-oil-first-time-goldman-2020-6  More on the way: “Of the 121 GW of new utility-scale generation applying to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the state’s grid operator, 75.3 GW are solar, 25.5 GW are wind and 14.5 GW are storage. Fossil fuels lag far behind, with natural gas at 5.4 GW and coal at 400 MW.”  https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2020/09/08/interconnection-queues-across-the-us-are-loaded-with-gigawatts-of-solar-wind-and-storage/  It better be well under $20/MWh to be competitive.ÿg8qwuyu
