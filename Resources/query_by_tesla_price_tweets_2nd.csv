That being said I would never buy one over Tesla, regardless of price."

2020-09-10T04:14:19.000Z,"Tesla is already capable of producing 500 mile range battery 5 years ago, but the car price would be skyrocketing at that time given that the cost of battery was still high at that time."

2020-09-10T04:06:35.000Z,They are options with a strike price that mature at 4 years. So you have to be at Tesla in four years time and the share price has to be higher than the strike price.

2020-09-10T03:10:48.000Z,He is also the owner of the company and took all the risk. And the stock market pushed Tesla to an insane price. Musk even said the stock was too high when it was 1/3 the price compared to now. Don’t blame Musk for Robin Hood traders increasing his net worth 3x.

2020-09-10T02:30:49.000Z,Why are Tesla owners complaining about the price of the Lucid Air when most of them own more than one Tesla? #tesla #lucidair
2020-09-10T02:15:45.000Z,"Well obviously there will be a used EV market for first time car buyers. Or lease. Tesla has an insanely cheap lease for like $379 for a Model 3. Since electricity is so much cheaper, it's on price parity with a $150-$200 gas car payment."
2020-09-10T02:11:26.000Z,"I don’t know who’s trashing the company, but people are trashing the price, forgetting Tesla also started at a very high price point. So I don’t see a problem with Lucid starting where they are."
2020-09-10T02:10:35.000Z,"@elonmusk

2020-09-10T02:10:09.000Z,They are. It's all about batteries. Not number of EV makers. Tesla is leading the way in battery cost reduction. They will reach price parity with gas cars this year. Electrification will win
2020-09-10T02:09:09.000Z,Lucid Motors reveals its long-awaited Air electric sedan.  High price but this is how Tesla started too and eventually worked it's way down in price.  32 sensors give it Level 2 & 3 autonomous driving. 500 mile range.
2020-09-10T02:07:24.000Z,Lucid Air price matches the Model S price almost perfectly. Can’t keep focusing on the higher trim levels. Tesla too started with a luxury sedan before moving towards more affordable vehicles. Have to start somewhere
2020-09-10T02:05:35.000Z,They can only manipulate million cap. Tesla is very big compare to them. They cant lower the price of tesla by 1 dollar with all there force

2020-09-10T02:00:49.000Z,"Stock price does not mean income and free cash. Many fortune 500 manufacturing companies had pay cuts in lieu of mass layoffs for Covid, including mine. The government shut down the means of production. The Tesla response was right and just."
2020-09-10T01:56:37.000Z,"No need to hate on Lucid.
Tesla is an EV brand for the mass market, Lucid is an EV brand for the top end luxury market.
Tesla focuses on its technology, software and battery tech, while Lucid does the same, but puts Luxury at the top of its list. The Lucid Air price matches that."
2020-09-10T01:49:12.000Z,More like the Taycan for that price range...
2020-09-10T01:38:38.000Z,This is a nice entry by Lucid Air and it looks like it competes favorably with @Tesla model S. But there is a reason why Model 3 and Y are top sellers and price has a lot to do with it.
2020-09-10T01:27:12.000Z,"While #Tesla can well go the #enron share price trajectory in future

The comparison is a bit misplaced

Tesla is on a bedrock of dreams that might never come true

Enron was on a bedrock of fraud and accounting malpractices"
2020-09-10T01:26:31.000Z,"Is Tesla's stock price justifiable? If Tesla were a car company, then I think the answer would be an emphatic no. But it isn't a car company. Tesla is a taxi and trucking company. (1/n)"
2020-09-10T01:03:57.000Z,"Agreed!  Even if at a slightly higher price point, would love to see Tesla revamp that."
2020-09-10T01:01:12.000Z,"Right now, any EV in the same price range is in direct competition with any other EV among those of us who made the ICE/EV decision first and then started looking at vehicles. Rivian's price drop took my eyes off of used Model Ses and new Model Ys. And I preordered the truck."
2020-09-10T00:52:54.000Z,"As a ""competitor"" of tesla...its not..which is what I was primarily referring to.  Model S is half the price for the specs.  As its own product as a SUPER LUXORY car like a lamborghini, its definitely #1"
2020-09-10T00:47:31.000Z,Competition is not going to stabilize #Tesla valuation.  #SpaceX and #Neuralink bring additional price speculation to the overall value of Tesla.
2020-09-10T00:44:06.000Z,They have created a great product that sets a new bar in what’s achievable for EVs.  It is a luxury product so price is going to be high when compared to Tesla. Very impressed with their product
2020-09-10T00:31:22.000Z,I see losses ahead on this product (nice but complicated) and a lot of capital raises to work their way down the product price curve to smaller sedans/hatch/SUV’s. Getting bought out by Ford/VW/GM/FCA is a very real possibility.   BigAuto will not let another Tesla gain momentum!

2020-09-08T21:16:07.000Z,I remember when the MODEL S and MODEL X cost $150k. Price will come down. Lucid is a new company. Stop comparing. Teslas goal is to get as many evs on the road as possible. You don't see Elon or Tesla bashing other EVs... We know who the REAL fans are....

2020-09-08T15:40:06.000Z,Zero sense? Minimise dilution by selling at high price makes sense if your asset/bonus is Tesla stocks. What makes zero sense is being precise about the amount of money but not number of shares. No way for other stock holders to know what the dilution will be.

2020-09-05T18:22:30.000Z,He is right in that Edison was a ceo and not the inventor we think of him as now. Tesla was the intellect. We so often forget the geniuses because they have other problems. That kind of intellect comes with a price.
2020-09-05T18:17:43.000Z,It all points to what is now more important; stock price.  But you won’t have growth if whole basis is word of mouth and that sours due to customer experience. He could turn all owners into co ambassadors again with that investment in service.

2020-09-05T17:00:21.000Z,"Bad idea. Tesla owners treat the battery like a precious thing. Battery would degrade much faster otherwise.

2020-09-05T16:00:22.000Z,CEOs everywhere should learn how Elon Musk converts Tesla’s 3% revenue growth into a 10x stock price.
2020-09-05T15:59:54.000Z,"And so we will see a round of heroic dip buying. I assure you the options dealers do not care about your valuation model, they will sell as the price drops. The short sellers will return and sell more as the price drops. And so it goes.

Tesla has likely reached its forever high."
2020-09-05T15:44:13.000Z,Not including Tesla with the 3 companies added to S&P 500 on Friday has nothing to do with where TSLA made its revenue and GAAP earnings.

2020-09-05T14:40:29.000Z,"Probably a good idea not to obsess over it. Based on the new entrants price moves after S&P 500 inclusion, one can hardly say it was momentous. Tesla has had single and multi-day moves (21%) well above the 4 or 6% these newbies realized. If it happens it happens."

2020-09-05T14:14:52.000Z,This was a self inflicted wound. Tesla investors pushed the price up too high and too fast so S&P had no choice but to wait. They don’t want the indexers to hold the bag when investors take profits after the inclusion. Small setback really

2020-09-05T08:45:29.000Z,Tesla (TSLA) today announced a $5 billion capital raise to take advantage of the stock price's meteoric rise. #M&A #Tax #NovaraCapital https://news.novara.group/1f5e1160 via @electrek
2020-09-05T08:45:16.000Z,I don't believe Tesla will use the ATM at lower than the price when it was announced and not unless there's a squeeze like event. I still believe that it's a tool to avoid too much volatility in a stock that very few participants are willing to part with.
2020-09-05T08:42:59.000Z,"PS. Please note that my comments assume no material price cuts. As @DeanSheikh1 always points out, with sufficient cuts, Tesla should be able to move any amount of metal."
2020-09-05T08:41:49.000Z,"Have we seen ‘peak Tesla’? They reached a market cap of over $450bn but last week the share price dropped dramatically and they were passed over for S&P inclusion. A pioneering company but competitors are everywhere, and to me they still look overvalued."
2020-09-05T08:18:53.000Z,Would you dare guess what that level may be and how they signal this? Biggest flaw to me is that few would believe Tesla would ever offer up ~10%+ of shares since buyback at lower price post index entering fully is far from certain. Also VA might have a heart attack.
2020-09-05T08:15:18.000Z,So tired of hearing S&P over and over. What does $tsla have to gain from inclusion besides possible price rise? We supporters shouldn’t be fixated on inclusion when we know the S&P comm are of people that are keen to preventing Tesla from any success
2020-09-05T08:01:41.000Z,"Simply draw out the logical conclusions for every assumption and you see there is no real downside for Tesla. Tesla competes not against other EVs, but ICE.

- although Tesla might do of course

More likely is that they will use something like a three-day average to avoid any claims of bias

Because Tesla has no reason to be biased in the price that they would use"
2020-09-05T07:15:53.000Z,I like very much ur interpretation...meaning that tesla fixed already a price (hope close to the price at announcement of capital raise) so these hedge will try to sell at that price (480$)...but still this would make sense for a S&P inclusion otherwise why this mess up?

2020-09-05T06:36:40.000Z,"Notice that Tesla only has to say that

They do not even have to sell one share

And let us imagine that they are prepared to release up to 100 million new shares"
2020-09-05T06:27:39.000Z,"The valuation of the share price is so far off it’s hilarious, you really think that Tesla should be worth more that VAG or Toyota then you obviously have no idea what those groups own, Toyota makes $1 million per employee, let that sink in for a second."
2020-09-05T06:26:31.000Z,An inclusion for Tesla would mean tracking funds would need to buy more than 120 million shares of Tesla stock - and probably they found it expensive at the current price point.

Does that prevent them from trading the event just before hand? I wonder if they ""managed"" a stable or up stock price through the split (same for $Aapl) like an IPO would be managed?"
2020-09-04T15:51:26.000Z,Bought about $5k worth of Tesla and Apple stock on Tuesday and I'm wishing I waited until today. Could have got them for a cheaper price. Fortunately I bought them with the thought of not selling for a few years. I'll just sit on them and wait.

2020-09-04T15:32:09.000Z,Zerohead comment. Tsla price doesnt need to do anything. @Tesla the company will increase in value by doing more things and doing the things it does better not by holding some price so the graph looks a certain way
2020-09-04T15:29:03.000Z,The difficulty many retail Tesla investors will have is they believe recent price validated their thesis. More likely it was a bubble driven by “greater fool” index buyers.

2020-09-04T15:04:57.000Z,"In my opinion there is no reason why Tesla couldnt fall back to 300-1000 usd pre split again. To be fair, the rise above the previous years long trading range (200-400 usd pre split) is suspicious, since a lot of stuff was price in already. Tesla is mainly a car company after all"

2020-09-04T14:55:37.000Z,Honestly whoever decided at Apple and Tesla to stock split right before September is a genius and is going to make people sooo much money. Worst market month 92 years straight and the 2 most popular stocks are now 1/5 the price and dipping

2020-09-02T05:59:55.000Z,Support the price today. Yes they do more than cars. But they will have to do a lot more.  I guess Tesla themselves will be sorry they only raised $5b when could he more if they sold in a few months time
2020-09-02T05:59:06.000Z,Inclusion of the S&P doesn’t make a company any more valuable. And shouldnt impact share price. When owning a company you don’t get anything for being in the S&P. The projection you provided assumes Tesla would have 33% market share and that validation is 10 year view doesn’t
2020-09-02T05:45:30.000Z,What do you mean another opinion. That’s fact. Stock splits don’t add 30% value to a company.  And Tesla sold shares to capitalize on surging stock price. Wouldn’t do it unless it was overvalued. If they thought it wasn’t overvalued they’d raise capital otherways
2020-09-02T05:35:42.000Z,It’s my opinion. But I haven’t seen 1 reason why Tesla is a good investment at $475 today. All I see is they capitalizing on overvalued share price that went up for a split....which added no value to the company
2020-09-02T05:34:31.000Z,Because I’m looking for something to convince me otherwise. I’ll I’ve heard is about Tesla but nothing to validate it’s share price

For UK stocks this often happens the same day but for overseas, like Tesla Inc, it can take longer. As the share price has updated this has led to you having a greater loss displayed. Tom"
2020-09-01T09:22:40.000Z,So now tesla has spilt the shares  which means if you are holding 1 share of tesla you will get 4 more shares ( in total 5 ) and due to spilt the price is down from 2000 to 498 ( playing with the  emotions of investors)

2020-09-01T02:55:05.000Z,No question Tesla has been innovative. What's preventing Toyota or Honda from executing the next level? Or offering 90% of function @ 75% of the price?  Too bad GM & Ford too unimaginative.  Europeans too pricey. Not a static market. Value w competition soon?
2020-09-01T02:53:44.000Z,"No, I do not. The problem with Tesla though is that Tesla only makes EVs. And these aren't inexpensive cars. They are far out of the price range of most Americans. It is a niche upper class market that is still being subsidized by a number of government programs and credits."
2020-09-01T02:53:18.000Z,I'm not so sure it's SO over-valued. The general market is realizing the extent at which TESLA is ahead of the competition. Now there are rumors of them launching a ride share network that will quickly go automated. The value of this may be closer to the current price..

2020-08-31T21:56:52.000Z,Tesla and apple split their stocks so it could be more affordable. Obviously everyone tried to buy but the platforms couldn’t handle it causing delays in purchases (while the stock price went up because anyone who could was buying). Some of the reactions were funny. Lol

2020-08-31T19:46:41.000Z,Tesla is a major hold. There’s larger potential for the long term. In 10 years Tesla could be the most valuable company in recent history and with a potential stock price of 20-30k by 2030. Already this year the price has went up 1000%. So imo it’s a hold.

-Haha Tesla Stonks go brrr"
2020-08-31T15:28:59.000Z,PSA. if you didn’t already hold tesla or apple before today you will not see an increase in shares. You will only see a decrease in the price. Your shares only increase on what you owned before the split. Don’t buy 1 share today and expect to have 5. The opportunity is the price
2020-08-31T15:26:56.000Z,Glad I bought Apple and Tesla before the split.... now all these scuffed Robinhood Jordan Belofort wanna be’s driving my price up

2020-08-31T15:08:58.000Z,think Tesla and Apple will both continue their runs going forward. Tesla has catalysts all the way to mid October which should keep the price up overall. Apple has new iPhones coming along with some other new service. Not financial advice just my thoughts
2020-08-31T15:07:21.000Z,Hour plus wait time for @TDAmeritrade right now. Watching the $TSLA (@Tesla) price climb. Going to kill myself if this hits $500 before I get someone on the line.

2020-08-23T18:56:11.000Z,"True. You can also squeeze 350,000 miles out of a good Toyota with much less headache than the first 50,000 in a Tesla, at 1/3 the price.

2020-08-23T15:12:26.000Z,"So- BEVs can be readily supplied. The fact that e208s, Kona EVs and Zoes are going for only 99€/mo in Germany speaks to a need to move metal to meet CO2 goals, not massive demand. Tesla also cut prices.

With Tesla you know that even Elon's family pay that sticker price!
2020-08-23T13:40:42.000Z,"You can’t look at the sticker price of an EV to see if it’s expensive. You’ll be spending 1/4 on fuel and almost nothing on maintenance. So you’ll be saving money that can go into loans payments.

2020-08-23T06:04:56.000Z,To clarify I’m suggesting a merger between Tesla and Apple valuing Tesla at 1/5 that of Apple. No price discovery means relative basis merger.

And is the higher price of the Porsche by £40000 really justified? Also, was the Tesla really build for speed?"
2020-08-23T05:52:10.000Z,The ID.3 is exactly the same price as the M3 and the high end Hyundai Kona - the ID.3 will not take sales from Tesla but it might take sales from Hyundai. Hyundai knows this and that is why they build a Kona EV factory in Europe very fast last year.

There were more price cuts since my tweet after Q2 end so as I stated, selling more widgets alone at lower prices is not whole story."

2020-08-22T23:58:31.000Z,For a US-car company having a single digit (%) market share in one sector (BEV) is a succsess.

2020-08-21T13:05:10.000Z,The stock being crazy high doesn't have any impact on Tesla has a business. It is near breakeven or maybe mildly profitable. They have done secondary stock sales earlier this year and raised a few billion $$$ at $780 per share. So the stock price helped put cash in the bank.
2020-08-21T12:59:57.000Z,I wrote a lengthy paper on Tesla 2 years ago. I also don't invest in single stocks or care about stock price.

2020-08-21T12:49:05.000Z,Just as I suspected...Tesla will hit 2.1k and the split price will be around 420. I got my coins ready.
2020-08-21T12:48:12.000Z,"Secondary is offering new stock at low price to investors like fund managers of s&p. This means dilution for common holders! If they announce secondary at 1900 , then stock may drop to that value! Although it has benefit of having extra cash for tesla but it dilutes current stock"

2020-08-21T12:20:54.000Z,A Tesla supercharger costs about £150k to install with all that factored in. So you get 20 multi-bay charging locations for the price of 1 limited capacity green hydrogen plant (which needs the water equal to about 100 homes). Or you need space and trucks delivering H2.
2020-08-21T12:13:39.000Z,"I think you can say that Tesla has caught the imagination of the Robin Hood Trader crowd, i.e. bubble, and it's also being driven by greater liquidity, i.e. dollar printing.

2020-08-21T12:04:12.000Z,The stock price rise is (obviously) a side product of the fact that Tesla IS executing and everyone can see it.

2020-08-21T06:22:50.000Z,@steve_sedgwick I agree re Tesla (and I love the tech and see it as a future major player) but my question is why isn’t @elonmusk using this share price to raise $10-$20b for mass expansion - v cheap cost of capital that no other car company has
2020-08-21T06:21:57.000Z,In the end both make cars? A good year ago Tesla was available for a price sales of ~1.5 and I think FCAU wasn’t that cheap.
2020-08-21T06:21:52.000Z,"Not sure but I don’t think so. As Tesla’s price goes up outside the index so does its inclusion weighting. In essence they still need to buy X percent.

2020-08-13T14:35:17.000Z,Using SVB is like buying an Oldsmobile when the Tesla of startup banking (@BankMercury) is available for half the price. Do you like using good products? Do you like saving money? Choose Mercury

2020-08-13T14:33:19.000Z,"•Fractional Shares•

Apple split, Tesla split but let’s not forget...

The ability to buy/own fractional shares is why stock splits don’t matter currently if you really want to own a piece of a company. Don’t let the full share price stop you "

2020-08-13T14:23:23.000Z,Suspect the committee have asked for more liquidity so I expect a share dilution announcement on the 22 September. Tesla knew that a split would increase the price due to the retail investors...this way the  institutions will have to pay more for extra shares  COH +$15Billion
2020-08-13T14:18:36.000Z,$TSLA is a story. Hopes and promises for a better future. Every news is a reason to buy.  Stock split ? Buy Tesla it must be positive. But I believe the rate of new hopes and promises is decelerating. Time to deliver on the actual promises is coming. Stock price will follow.
2020-08-13T14:10:38.000Z,I wouldn’t be surprised if Tesla was doing a 1 for 10 reverse split at some point in the future here. Most people who care about share price could explain market cap if you paid them. I had a bunch of guys in their 20’s working for me. No clue.
2020-08-13T14:09:03.000Z,Review TESLA’s EBITDA at next earnings release and see if actual results meet estimated Forward P/E ratios. A correction will be reflected in market price if forward P/E predictions are inaccurate.
2020-08-13T14:00:43.000Z,"Tesla could do it, but large exchanges have rules that start the delisting process if a stock trades below $1 for 30 days. Companies generally want their price over $5 to not be labeled a penny stock."
2020-08-13T14:00:32.000Z,The split will probably hurt other EV stocks as the avg investors will just buy Tesla at a more affordable price per share

2020-08-13T13:36:32.000Z,"It is called fraud.  

@elonmusk is keeping the price up so the residual value of his leased cars can remain high on the books so tesla can fake a profit and get included in the S&P 500 and he can dump his shares into the endless void of market index funds."
2020-08-13T13:25:52.000Z,"Tesla’s 5-1 split is going to send it even higher. Buy and hold. I predict it will creep back up to the pre-split price within a couple years, and you’ll have 5 times as many shares. $TSLA"
2020-08-13T13:15:20.000Z,I wonder what effect that retail investors have on the price of Tesla and what effect that institutional investors have.
2020-08-13T13:08:57.000Z,My hope is Tesla will start shipping Chinese model 3s here and greatly lower the price or even bette longer term is if they make a gigafactory in Japan. The Model 2 and the minivan could sell super well here if they make them the right size.
2020-08-13T13:07:25.000Z,@elonmusk abuye more Tesla after split like a boss just imagine where his 10m at 735 or whatever price point is now? Where would it be after the split and his new 10m purchase at stock split price $420? Exactly $42069Blazeit

Tesla $TSLA declares a 5 for 1 split of its shares effective August 31st. Will the share price of the stock go up  or down  prior to the stock split? As of now there is definitely up action prior to today's session. #StocksAndCryptos"
2020-08-13T12:56:28.000Z,"I have a sneaking suspicion that the split is related to S&P 500 inclusion.   I can imagine the index committee told Tesla their constraints (on price and share count availability) and made the split request as a condition of their inclusion.   Can’t prove it, but it makes sense."
2020-08-13T12:48:52.000Z,"I saw the buying in the single digits. 

Obviously, not much as the price increased, but it's always a big statement when management continues to buy. 

Loved @Noursalehi wanting more equity 

Loved when @elonmusk bought more on the raise at ~767 for Tesla"

2020-08-13T12:43:59.000Z,Looks like Tesla is using every trick in the book to keep its stock price high or stock from falling.

2020-08-13T12:35:09.000Z,"It’s just not at a price point that makes sense for me to buy. An EV just isn’t going to last me 15 years without significant maintenance. Tesla manufacturing and parts availability just isn’t up to par, yet, especially depending on where you live"

2020-08-13T12:16:52.000Z,The $2000 foldables are targeted at enthusiasts with the ultimate goal of decreasing the price of foldable displays so that the displays can be used in cheaper devices. Tesla did this with the Roadster to fund development for the M3. This isn’t a new phenomenon.
2020-08-13T12:15:45.000Z,It’s like you aren’t making a relevant comparison and tried to get away with it but that didn’t go that well for you...what’s changed for Tesla in 10 years beside the stock price revenue sales perhaps? Now do the other legacy automakers when they were a going concern for 16 years
2020-08-13T12:08:21.000Z,Tesla chart long term on Log scale: I think around 1680 would be a strong resistance and a great spot to short this crazy price action.

2020-08-13T11:37:35.000Z,While national news focused on the #ChicagoRiots and looting of the Tesla dealership. This happened. People are out of control. Kids ultimately pay the price for a lack of cracking down on rioters and looters. #lorilightfoot
2020-08-13T11:11:50.000Z,"You are describing leasing, nothing revolutionary. Also tesla offers recharging stations, potentially making money selling electricity to customers. Lastly the real money is not with fuel but autonomy. Nikola has yet to build 1 station producing H2 at the price they claim."
2020-08-13T11:04:45.000Z,Tesla price of the stock doesn't match it's profits nor it's future profits for like 15 years.  Apple is not growing much but a very large price compared to earnings.   I think it's lower risk to buy the indexes right now you are not definitely getting those stocks at a discount
2020-08-13T10:54:06.000Z,"Tesla has about 600 Mio. cash in deposits, Semi likely has anything between 15k to 30k paid Semi (!) reservations. Also Nikola Tre BEV has substantial higher price at lower range and performance, it really isn't a competition to Tesla if one knows how to use an abacus."
2020-08-13T10:53:21.000Z,True  we need more than only @tesla or the few @IONITY_EU in Belgium. Found the price  without any deals.
2020-08-13T10:51:03.000Z,"(2) In the Dow index companies are weighted by share prices, Tesla's high share price would have given it too large a weight, solution? Stock split.

2020-08-13T07:18:44.000Z,Sometimes they sell Tesla and put the profits into a different stock. They have rules about how much they can hold as well as when they can buy more or sell. Eg. They can't buy more if the price drops but they're already at 10%. And so on. It's not just about Tesla for them. /2
2020-08-13T06:45:38.000Z,"By their own test they get 28% more range than a Model S if that is achieved with just 10% more battery that's amazing, if it's with 25 or more % it's the same as Tesla. Don't get me wrong, that is great but at double the price it doesn't wow me or change the landscape that much."
2020-08-13T06:37:21.000Z,"It's affordable for what it is.

2020-08-12T05:05:24.000Z,"Hey Clay! Can you explain what is the benefit for an investor if a stock is split like Tesla is going to split 1:5? I know they reduce the price of share, but how does that add value to the investment of an investor?"
2020-08-12T05:01:32.000Z,Hindsight? It was only a couple of weeks ago that TSLA was trading a half its current price. How much hindsight is needed? I'd say it's just FOMO hitting lemming investors who magically become interested in a stock after it's already run it's course 1000%
2020-08-12T05:00:53.000Z,So once the split happens Tesla will drop immediately to somewhere around that price range?

2020-08-12T04:46:52.000Z,This is where investors see the future heading.  Tesla as the leader into the electroc future.  Apple has shown us that you don’t have to be the market leader to sustain value or a high stock price.

2020-08-12T04:17:45.000Z,So what say you on the price of $Tesla just before the split? I'm saying $1850. If we also get the S&P announcement all bets are off. Could be ludicrous mode!
2020-08-12T04:16:34.000Z,Tesla announces 5-for-1 stock split. Stocks up about 7% after market. So depends on what price it's at on August 31. If it is 1500 then retail investors can now get it for an affordable ~ $300 per share. :) #Tesla $tsla
2020-08-12T04:09:52.000Z,"In short, it means that each Tesla shareholder will see their number of shares held increase by a factor of 5, but the value of the share will be adjusted accordingly. This aims to reduce the price per share and as $Tesla put it."

2020-08-12T03:48:24.000Z,"Tesla's five-for-one stock split won't change how much the business is worth, but will automatically reduce the price of its shares by 80% when it's completed on Aug. 31."

2020-08-12T03:28:34.000Z,Unless Tesla surprisingly announces full self driving availability in all markets I don’t think the current market will price it anywhere close to that. What do you say?
2020-08-12T03:26:50.000Z,Often people say you can't compare two companies that have a large difference in outstanding shares. After the Tesla split the shares will be very similar. I think it makes it easier to compare the two. The Tesla split with reduce their stock price to approximately $300  1/2

2020-08-11T21:12:05.000Z,Every stock you own gets you 5 new ones. However his doesn’t mean they are worth more because the value is split by 5 as well. They do it because the stock price is pretty high atm so more retail investors and Tesla employees can buy at lower cost.

2020-08-07T02:52:59.000Z,"Free? Ok but NOT unlimited. That's asking too much. After all, even if they charge some money, they can still have a huge price and prestige advantage. Why prestige? Because Tesla superchargers have solar panels so you can't be told you use dirty electricity."
2020-08-07T02:51:30.000Z,"So Elon would have to liquidate a large portion of his shares in Tesla causing the price per share to plummet wiping away wealth for thousands and potentially destabilizing the employment of tens of thousands of people.

There is a difference between wealth and net worth."

2020-08-07T01:16:39.000Z,To me nothing is worth looking at without an extensive DCFC network available like Tesla has. I never consisered the S nor X one due to price but two because of infrastructure. Then comes model3 where infrastructure is there and price point is there...and I was in!
2020-08-07T01:04:08.000Z,They could increase it as they have 3 years until production but my main disappointment was 150kW charging. You'd think that they'd be able to do 200kW+ since tesla could do it in 2018 (with a smaller battery at that). As long as the price isn't too crazy it sounds pretty good

2020-08-07T00:07:41.000Z,No need for secondary. If S&P wants to add Tesla they just have to add it. It’s pretty low now considering their execution anyway. At $1800 maybe a secondary would be justified. But not here. Plenty of liquidity at the right price.
2020-08-07T00:05:52.000Z,"I disagree. Because the assumption is that somehow Musk's ownership of Tesla is artificially propping up the share price. That doesn't quite follow. He's not a maj. shareholder. You will absolutely find buyers at the 1500 price, unless you're saying Tesla is a bad investment."

2020-08-06T23:41:48.000Z,As they get more cars on the road! 5) there balance sheet is way better now as their stock price skyrocketed they raised money at a huge value. 6) tesla now has 4 qtrs of profitability & should hit S&P 500.  Also only car manufacture to put more cars on road during Covid then pre
2020-08-06T23:40:03.000Z,It’s probably just like buying the newest iPhone. Why spend 800 on one where another ones going to come out same price next year.
2020-08-06T23:37:47.000Z,The cheapest model with no additional features is around that price.

One is an SUV, the other a Track Car"
2020-08-06T22:48:25.000Z,"Definitely the Model 3 or Model Y. Can’t get a better car for the price, no matter what trim you select."

2020-08-04T05:19:55.000Z,The price of electricity to Tesla is not actually the same as you get in your home. There is an added pricing in sucking the electricity at a high rate. This surge charge can be up to 2-3x the normal price based for example on the regularity of the event...

2020-08-01T14:06:47.000Z,Teslas drivers are from safer demographic than the avg driver is. No 18 yo picking up a tesla for a few dollars and crashing it. Comparison should be between cars of the same year/price. I bet the safety advantage would vanish if they were comparing like with like. @TESLAcharts

2020-08-01T13:44:25.000Z,"Haha the turbo electric car 
Well, Tesla has a high stock price and Taycan has a too high car price for the performance you get from a Tesla whom they obviously tried to beat in Nurburgring since they're a sports car brand which Tesla isn't. Let's wait for Battery Day. "

2020-08-01T13:21:08.000Z,Tesla makes 10% of the cars made by biggest car companies like Toyota and VW they are valued over all of them.

2020-08-01T09:27:56.000Z,It’s probably true.   I think $TSLA dipped because people are just taking in profit but also below is a 3wk chart.  Tesla might continue to dip Monday early than bounce up but stay within (maybe a little out) of 3 wk triangle.  The price is getting squeezed
2020-08-01T09:27:14.000Z,Tesla is a overpriced stock and is like a house of cards they make cool cars but one bad thing will bring them down they can't keep up with thier stock price ever nor they have the finances to support it.
2020-08-01T09:17:14.000Z,Also range vs price matters. Tesla is loosing ground there unless battery day reveals some magic. Will make our cars worthless btw.
