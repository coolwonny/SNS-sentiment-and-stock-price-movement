BMW has stated that they should be able to produce fCEVs for less than BEVs by 2025. If Hyundai is on a similar path, there will be serious competition, particularly in vehicles on consistent routes (think buses, trucking, trains, planes, drones) by then.

Why he will sell his mother if it would hurt the guys shorting tesla; read onNow a new email leaked on Tesla fan site Tesmanian hints the company could break its 2020 goal of producing over 500,000 vehicles for the year. To reach this goal, Tesla will need to produce approximately 182,000 vehicles, around 40,000 more than the company's previous quarter production of 145,000 units.See Also: Tesla Option Trader Bets M On 29% Upside From Here"It will be tough, but super exciting if we can exceed half a million cars made in a single year for the first time in Tesla history!" said Musk's email, according to the leak."When we started Tesla just over 16 years ago, I never thought we would get this far, but, thanks to your hard work and ingenuity, we actually have a chance of making half a million cars in a single year. Wow, that is so incredible!! This all comes down to Q4. Please take whatever steps you can think of to improve output (while increasing quality)."Benzinga's Take: Email "leaks" have become pretty common for Telsa in recent years. After nearly facing bankruptcy during the Model 3 ramp-up in 2017, the company and stock have been a massive roll, running up from a split-adjusted share price of around $70 to its current price north of $420.|

Oct. 7, 2020 6:34 PM ET|About: Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)|By: Carl Surran, SA News Editor

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) gains a new bull as New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu upgrades shares to Buy from Neutral and raises his price target to a Street-high $578 from $400 previously, saying the company has a "decade of hyper growth ahead" and has "no credible competition on the horizon."

The company now addresses the entire premium segment, with high-end and mid-end sedan and SUV models, which is an 8M-unit market globally, New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu notes.

"Amazon has traded in the 50x-100x earnings range for over a decade, and we expect Tesla to follow suit," Ferragu writes.

Before the upgrade, the wide majority of analysts rated TSLA at Neutral, with a $336 average price target:|

17 hours ago•Last reply 2 hours ago| Lots of shorts in this board, why? Because there is a concerted effort to manipulate the stock by certain companies who stand to loose. Conspiracy theory? I don’t think so. In the past technology that would help electric car manufacturer where bought by these companies just to be lockup in their closet never to be used. Some of these technology cost billions of dollars and was never used or released only when those electric car companies went belly up. The technology revolves around battery mileage...can you believe there where technology way back that would have made batteries range to 300 miles? There are a total of 50 electric companies that failed in the past. The tactics used was to heavily short the stock, release so called electric car models that are similar in name to the competition to muddy the waters a bit and kill the model once the EV company is out of business. Yup you heard it and you can google that stuff too. Not only they killed their own EV models but they also made sure not a single car exist (by crushing it) except in a museum....now that takes a lot of effort.
You can see signs of manipulation on Tesla stock by how irrational it behaves.|

SunPower Corporation
SPWR 11.02%
, Overweight rating, $20 price target.

I sense a lot of frustration that the company could be down 7% (to about $450 billion market cap) after showing sales of 140,000 vehicles in the quarter.

If they continue to average $50,000/vehicle, then that is $7 billion in revenue, if they make a 2% margin, then $140MM in profit. But this quarter, the share price has risen $215 or about $260 billion in market cap.

That's just a mania . . . insane by any measure.

If TESLA could beat all estimates during the horrible Covid downturn, he should be able to beat projections for 2021. Think about it? Follow the daily progress at GigaShanghai, the progress at GigaBerlin and at GigaTexas and you will realize that 2021 could be the year of geometric increase in revenue, margins and earnings.

For the year so far in Norway, 54,503 EVs were sold. 3,524 of those were Tesla vehicles (6.4%)

As competition enters markets, Tesla's market share tends to decline.

If the world buys 5MM EVs in 2025 and Tesla only has 6.4% share, that is only 320,000 vehicles.
Let's triple it!! Let's say they end up with 20% share . . . that's 1MM vehicles . . . in 2025.

It could go better, it could go worse.

With the chance that no broad-based help will happen before the election, the reality now exists for little or no growth to end 2020 and begin 2021.

The two cohorts that will be hurt the most are displaced workers and small businesses.

One projection is that the economy will lose $60 billion a month just from the loss of unemployment benefits.

Other projections see continued layoffs and damage to multiple industries.|

yesterday•Last reply 6 hours ago| How many companies have growth 36%

Tesla's prospective growth in Unit volume this year is 36%. Their revenue won't grow so much due to the increasing share of the Model 3 (lower average sales prices), but I did a quick look at companies on the Nasdaq with growth (in revenue) of > 36%.

Of the 3,686 Nasdaq companies I compared,
1308 companies had growth of less than 36%
454 companies reported revenue growth of greater than 36% (highest was tiny GNFT with 44,594% growth)
1,924 didn't have data, or didn't calculate growth (i.e. ETFs, Preferreds, and stocks with negative growth)

That leads to the question, why is Tesla so special? They don't make money. There is a low probability for excellent margins/earnings. The company has broad and deeply entrenched competition.

Where is the magic? I have heard all of the major arguments: Batteries, EV growth, Veblen goods, Autonomous platform. I think I have discounted all of those as (mostly) pie in the sky (and Tesla's end markets look like they are coming to the same conclusion), so what is the magic?

Respectful replies are appreciated.

Thanks,

yesterday•Last reply 7 hours ago| Stimulus relief is mostly irrelevant as far as TESLA is concerned. Concentrate on revenue growth, earnings growth, free cash flow, net cash ($14 BILLION) to complete the vision and huge gigafactories in Berlin and Texas coming on line beginning in early 2021 which will push
production into close to a million next year. This will include all new carmodels plus the cybertruck and the semi. TESLA is the best positioned automotive EV company in the world
and they accelerating production, revenue and free cash even during the coronavirus so called pandemic. This is not even counting it's solar roof bussiness, it's battery bausiness, it's electrical utility business, etc. etc. Keep your eyes on the facts while the stock manipulators
continue using this political and virus turmoil to create fear, uncertainty, and doubt in order to first cash in on their FUD and then buy shares of TSLA at a discount.|

So what is the value of production 1 million vehicles every year probably starting next year. What is the value of autonomy, that is a bit harder to quantify but for me autonomy is going to fetch premium price as long as Tesla is the only one that has it so based on how behind everyone else is, I give it 10 years before everyone catches up. This will mean Tesla will completely dominate the industry and autonomous vehicle will be valued at premium. So $4000 in 3 years is very realistic and conservative.|

2 days ago•Last reply 8 hours ago| Real Deal W here.
low ( for TSLA) open interest and dollar value , combined with LDV being not far from current price makes this week's oct 9 option expiration a relatively SMALL factor in the shareprice dynamic this week. Next week oct 16 is a different story, likely a more significant effect but not as huge as we have seen for a monthly. The big one , a truly monumental potential effect and test for the TSLA shareprice dynamic is the former leap jan 15 2021 expiration. Will look to post more about that in the future.
Also seeing SIGNIFICANT indicators further confirming that the "historic" confluence of hyperbullish story effect leading to the predicted top in the immediate post split timeframe , which was marked in a premarket session at the aprox $533 will be truly a very durable top in the at least the short term, further enhancing my many times expressed view that the Extreme pumpers who predict huge upside moves in the next few months, are to be ignored......................|

Tesla garnered 5 orders today in Norway for 1.8% of daily BEV sales.
For the month, they have 1.9% of BEV sales (31 of 1,613)
For the year they have 7.1% of BEV sales (3,936 of 55,194)

It is notable that their market share is dropping rapidly while competition (# of models) is rising.

Just because the data is in front of me . . .
VW (all brands) has captured 633 of 1,613 or 39% share for the month.
Hyundai (all brands) has 261 of 1,613 or 16.2% share for the month.

16 models have sold more than the Model 3 so far this month.
4 models have sold more than the Model 3 so far this year.

Competition is coming.

As more free supercharging cars are being retired as they are traded in, as well as the free data connectivity, there are lower costs for maintaining the legacy fleet. These aren't huge numbers when you look at them individually, but combining them will surely drive up margins.|

Say Tesla sells close to 1 million next year at an average of 45,000 per vehicles, that would give them some 45 billion in revenue. If they can maintain close to 20% margins, that would give them $9 billion in earnings. With 900 million shares that would equal $9 per share.

yesterday•Last reply 13 hours ago| Many reason Tesla will go up in price. 1. Tesla WILL eventually be added to the S&P either probably in year 2020 or 2021. This news alone will double the price of Tesla stock 2. Tesla as an EV has over 900+power stations in the country and who knows how many overseas. This took many billions of dollars in investments. Currently not a single competitor of Tesla has built their eco system. Which EV car company do you see right now that has that advantage? None! This is first mover advantage people! 3. Tesla pivot their battery to consume nickel which is cheaper and more abundant to harvest. The rest of the battery manufacturers are still using lithium which gets more expensive long term. As orders pour in for Tesla demand is generated and supply will follow 4. Tesla 1st ver of its car which is 8+ years ago is still cutting edge technology. Not a single car manufacturer currently EV or even gas has caught up with its technology. This is fact jack 5. Tesla did announce of million mile battery. This significantly and exponentially reduces cost of ownership of any Tesla or any of its product that uses battery to levels that many experts indicated is 6 years ahead of any competition. The million mile battery will have implication from the trucking industry 6. Tesla has 2+ billion miles of autonomous experience which is constantly improving and the nearest competition only has 2 million miles (Waymo) of autonomous experience. Just do the math, to get to where Tesla is competition has to have real driving conditions. Tesla got to Billion miles because it actually has cars on the street. 7. Tesla giga factory is not only producing cars, but also battery, solar roof tiles which makes its cost of operation significantly cheaper than any car manufacturers in the world who many factory only serve one purpose. Tesla competitors have to retool their factory to compete and that is investment dollars they don?t even have. 8. Tesla giga uses proprietary cutting edge design to make it 20x more efficient than any current factory in the world today. It has less carbon foot print and is almost 80% or more operated by robots. It runs 24 hours a day....how many car company can you say do that. 9. Tesla cars is now going 7 versions ahead with the only vehicle currently can do over the air updates. This means the Tesla you bought recently will have a higher resale value than any used car out there right now. Don?t believe me just check Edmunds or blue book. Aloe 10. Tesla insurance will spread to cars, trucks, homes, etc. this is significant advantage as Tesla has the data to properly #$%$ risk and they own the parts which further reduce their reimbursement cost. This alone is very big 11. Tesla will turn on its Robo taxi service in the next 1-2years, probably when autonomous day is official and approved for public use. This will allow Tesla owners to have their cars earn money for them as a taxi service while they go to work. And the estimate earning potential for each car is $30,000 a year. 12. Tesla as a taxi service will destroy the business model of all ride hailing service currently out there who gives back 80% of its revenue back to the driver. Experts estimated Tesla cost cost will be just 30% much much lower than any out there.|

Yeah, I remember it too. I was excited.

Fuel Cell technology is doing the same in major parts of the world. Five years from now some of these companies (BMW, Hyundai, Honda, well, most major auto manufacturers really) could have leapfrogged the BEV design with FCEL designs (the need for batteries is dramatically smaller).

Changes are coming. It will all be good for the planet!!

18 hours ago•Last reply 15 hours ago| SenileOleJoe's plan to raise taxes includes raising capital gains taxes to the same rate as orinary income.

In other words he would multiply the 15% long term capital gains tax rate almost 3 fold.

Here's the rub, the money used to generate capital gains has already been taxed at ordinary income tax levels.

That is, you take your hard earned already taxed net income afterUncleSam takes his part and try to invest to make a little more. If you're successful, you get taxed again. If not, you're limited to $3000 per year on the losses you can deduct from other income.

So capital gains shouldn't be taxed at all. It's double taxation.

Now SenileOleJoe wants to double your ordinary tax rate. That is, you pay ordinary taxes on the capital to invest, then if you make a profit, SenileOleJoe wants to tax your profits at ordinary income rates again.

Example let's say one of you cult members actually did buy tesla at the IPO price and now have a net worth of a couple million.

If you sold underSenileOleJoe's plan, 97% of that, nearly $2 million would be taxed at 40% vs 15%.

While you've been a responsiblelawabiding citizen, $800,000 of your nearly $2 million hard earned profit would go toSenileOleJoe and what would be acommunistgovernment to pay off other people's college debt, pay for their college tuition, pay for their "living wage", pay for their healtcare, pay for their sloth, pay for theirabortions, to pay off wacko exbartenderAOC's new country destroying green deal,... because she andberniesanders know better than you how to spend your money.|

Also in German market, there is a Korean car maker called SSangyong. They had a -29% car registration decline according to the German article. I bet this company will not survive. They have no electric car to offer. They will slowly disappear. I have never seen this brand before in the USA even.|

YoY sales growth (43%) - comparing Q3 2019 vs. Q3 2020
TTM sales growth (21%) - comparing Q4,Q1,Q2,Q3-2019 vs. Q4,Q1,Q2,Q3-2020
YTD sales growth (24%) - comparing Q1-Q3 2019 vs. Q1-Q3 2020

While that 43% number looks pretty good, looking at it more broadly suggests that growth is slowing . . . the two big factors include a massive influx of competitors that are ramping and significant new production capability by Tesla that will hit about the same time.

Also instructive . . . Tesla commented that they are reducing inventory, but that doesn't seem to be the case. They produced about 6,000 cars more than they sold in the quarter but they already had $1.5 billion in inventory (not all of which will be new cars).

Very interesting data when we see China's sales numbers and Germany/UK numbers for Europe (specifically looking for competition information).

Until now, competitors and big oil used the media (who are paid to advertise for them) to create FUD about Tesla to years. Now with Tesla scaling their proprietary battery technology you should expect utility companies begin to recognize Tesla as an existential threat through its sustainable energy capture, storage, intelligent distribution software, and microgrid solutions. Tesla is a disruptor of some of the largest sectors - commercial and consumer transport & energy. Don't fall asleep on this opportunity. You may never see another like it.|

eWays is all about Renault's electrification

As for BEVS, Renault has ZOE, Twingo Z.E., Kangoo Z.E., Master Z.E. and Twizy. On the PHEVs front, it counts on Captur E-TECH Plug-in Hybrid and Megane Estate E-TECH Plug-in Hybrid. For FCVs, it has Kangoo Z.E. Hydrogen. With HEVs, it has Clio E-TECH Hybrid, Arkana E-TECH Hybrid. Renault will deliver a small battery-powered SUV.

Trump is not perfect, but the fact that he had very little to no collaboration from other parties didn’t let him deliver the best of his capabilities. Shame on you if you hated from day one, shame on you. I would honestly vote for republican candidate, like romney, but it’s not an option.

So why/how did Tesla fall 20% ? It definitely isn’t the Robinhooders with there stimulus checks they don’t have that kind of power.

Yes, while I presume the FSD rewrite is proceeding with some measure of success.....I very little confidence the public is ready to jump into a driverless Taxi......even if Elon “promises” that they have ironed out all the bugs.

How successful has TSLA been in “ironing out the bugs” of defective control arms....that’s a rhetorical question.|

yesterday•Last reply yesterday| I haven't been keeping track of whether other industrialized nations are printing as much money as the US, but it's relative.

If the EU etc is devaluing the Euro etc at the same rate the US is destroying the dollar with all of this stimulus, no harm.

If the US is largely out printing others, there will be a huge reckoning in the US. The Fed never shook of the $4 trillion it put on the balance sheet for the 2009libinduced financialcrisis.

And with thelibs looking to unfairly forgive all current student debt, provide free college, free healthcare (the only reason healthcare is so expensive now is because the government got involved) and other free insane policies, we could reallybephecked.

yesterday| I wonder if people will see the suspension problem as an issue if it comes from somewhere other than this message board?

https://insideevs.com/news/447593/tesla-suspension-issues-owners-true-stories/

It's certainly not a one car problem, a one model problem.

It all comes back to the question . . . how will Tesla handle a recall. No one has answered that, but hopefully some have contemplated the effect of that awesome sales model where there are no dealers.

(I don't normally like to criticize a company on POSSIBLE problems with the business model (aka unqualified hits to profitability), but in this case, it is easy to see that this is a weakness in the business model at an unknown cost, I think it is worth criticizing. The no dealer model will be very, very hard on customers and profits if the cars were to be recalled to inspect and replace all of their suspension control arms. It's not clear to me how they would even inspect and service 1 MM vehicles.)

yesterday| White House press secretary downplays possibility of Trump national address today
From CNN's Betsy Klein
White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany appeared to downplay the possibility of a presidential address as soon as Tuesday, saying “no decision had been made.”

“He certainly does want to address the nation at some point. But in terms of timing of that, certainly no plans as of today, but I think they’re always fast moving so should that change, we’ll be sure to let you know,” she said during an appearance on Fox Business.
McEnany noted that Trump has been seen “on camera each and every day since he contracted the Covid-19 virus, and I’ll bet you’ll see him in some form today.”|

yesterday| What did just happen?|
yesterday| What happened? All the indexes turn red?|
yesterday•Last reply yesterday| S&P, Dow, and Nasdaq went red all of the sudden. What did Trump do now?|
yesterday| I just saw a headline that made me laugh: "The Trade Desk is Very Extended and Looks Vulnerable Again."

As a TTD investor since 2017, I actually agree with this article. TTD's current PE ratio is at 240, which is extremely high, even for a high growth company. What made me laugh is that if TTD is very extended, TSLA is the balloon on the verge of popping. TSLA currently has a PE ratio of just under 1100! So let's see if their growth rate warrants this valuation and compare it to TTD's. I'm talking about revenue growth, by the way, not delivery growth. Starting in 2017, TSLA's annual revenue increased by 68%, 83%, and 15%. Trailing 12 month growth ending 2Q2020 was only 3%. TTD's annual revenue increased by 52%, 55%, and 39%. TTM growth was 21%. The spike in TSLA's growth in 2017 and 2018 was due to increased deliveries of the Model S/X, which were 101k and 99k, respectively. 2018 also had 245k Model 3 deliveries. So what caused the drop from 83% growth to only 15%? Model S/X deliveries fell off the cliff, and that trend continues this year. So what Telsa has done is sacrifice revenue growth for delivery growth. They continue to do that this year, lowering their prices several times, including a recent 8% drop in China. Tesla then is no longer a high growth company by any means, at least in terms of revenue. Even if Tesla is able to deliver 500k this year, which is extremely unlikely given that they will need to deliver 181k in the fourth quarter, revenue growth would be less than 20%. With fewer sales of their high end vehicles, margins will be constricted. They also front loaded much of the regulatory credit sales in the first two quarters, so they will not have very many for the rest of this year. That too will hurt their margins. Look for their PE ratio to increase, rather than decrease, in the foreseeable future.|

4 days ago•Last reply yesterday| For traditional car makers to compete with Tesla they need to dedicate 100% of their engineering focus on developing EV cars. They can’t do that for one simple reason, their cash cow is still selling ICE cars so they still have to maintain engineering on those areas until they get to the point where their EV is ready for prime time. So in other words they can’t so now they are splitting their engineering to ICE and EV base case 50% each and trying to compete with Tesla with 100% of their engineering resources and money on EV....who do you think is going to win? Another advantage Tesla has is they have all these other areas that they do business in and the engineering in those cross pollinate to other areas of business, I suspect making new metals came from Spacex, making indestructible glass bled thru solar roof tiles. And break through in power wall probably improved the battery and bled thru the cars. That is the competitive advantage of Tesla engineering. The traditional ICE companies don’t stand a chance.|

yesterday•Last reply yesterday| i have been following the EV market from the beginning, Tesla is the most discussed stock. Lots of people thought it is way overvalued (including me) but after all said and done you look around the market you only see Tesla cars in every town and it keeps growing. Other "cheap" EV stock are everywhere but i don't see any real car/truck coming anytime soon. What people need is a real car to drive this year, now ... not in the plan. Tesla is still dominating the market, regardless|

Even good companies with big industrial value fell to nothing. I lost aaaall the money that I made in 1999- 2000. I didn't understand how irrational things had become. Just like you people holding Tesla. That's why I say to you now: SELL. Because Tesla is a 40bln Company, not 400. I will make a fortune on the downfall, but it doesn't have to be your money, that I make. You don't have to be poor, you can sell and be happy.

yesterday•Last reply yesterday| PS TRADERS TO REDUCE SHORT SELLING ie. To avoid your broker from "lending your shares to short sellers" put a sell order for $2000 or something to high to be reached on your TSLA stock, This prevents your shares from being lent out by the broker because there is a sell contact on them.|
yesterday| Tesla's China sales numbers should be available in a few days, but some other Chinese vendors are highlighting their figures already. For future comparison, here are the numbers for three US listed Chinese automakers:

Sept Q3 YTD
NIO 4,708 12,206 26,375
XPeng 3,478 8,578
Li Auto 3,504 8,660 18,168

These companies all grew quickly, but from a very small base. I am also waiting for the Wuling numbers as the low end market leader, it will be interesting to see if the excitement holds for another month (or two).

The next quarters' results and confirmation of 500k deliveries for the year, which I believe is already in the bag (I expect c.20,000 were held back from the last numbers to make sure) will lead to a final capitulation by short sellers in March 2021 as there will be virtually no shares for sale to cover.

yesterday| Bully
verb

seek to harm, intimidate, or coerce (someone perceived as vulnerable).

Elon Musk was seriously bullied as a child. It hasn’t stopped yet. Only now that he’s a blazingly successful billionaire it’s gotten worse. His powerful detractors are huge industrial competitors, regulatory bodies and some vicious media. It will continue as he perennially disrupts other legacy factions. He’s often stated he’s not in all this for the wealth and fame. It’s proven by his continued doubling, down mostly with his own resources. His loyal investors are and will continually be richly rewarded.|
yesterday•Last reply yesterday| Tesla dropping prices was big mistake. Huge drop in margins just to try and meet a yearly sales goal is foolish. Hurting Q4 EPS and likely negative earnings is a poor decision by management to try and get to 500k cars sold.

13 days ago•Last reply yesterday| $IPNFF (ImagineAR) Best way to educate people about the deal is through facts.

Here are some of the key highlights about the benefits from this deal.

ImagineAR has access to ALL NFL Alumni players in which they can’t utilize them for revenue generating campaigns, events, promotions, etc.
NFL “Academy” is just beginning. This is the kickoff so to speak. ImagineAR will significantly be involved in this launch.
Significant revenue to be made from this deal and the bread crumbs it will generate. Put this into perspective everyone. When will TOM BRADY retire!? ImagineAR will work together on sponsorship branding campaigns for any NFL Alumni player member for the next 5 years.
Sponsorship money for players, 37 chapters, brands, monetize sale of unique content. Lots of money to be made over the next 5 years.
So in summary, sounds pretty EPiC to me! And let’s be honest, this is AP we are talking about...I’m sure there will be lots more to come and very soon|

2 days ago•Last reply yesterday| There are a few options here.
1. The stock keeps moving up but I would give that a less probability of the other 2.
When I refer to moving up at the clip that's been traveling. ( This could make a new all time high but I don't see it smashing the old one! aka .25 - $ 50.00 over the previous high. I would'nt count on that senario!
2. The stock moves sideways for the next 3 to 5 years. Look at tesla from 2014 - 2019!
3. The stock crashes down like the year 2000! Then another 10 plus years to catch up to this old ATH. MSFT is a great example.

yesterday•Last reply yesterday| Comparing Tesla sales to VW and Renault in Germany.

The result is inconclusive, but the author suggests that the Renault ZOE was the best seller in Germany in September with 3,600 units, the Tesla Model ID.3 in second or 3rd with 3,065 and the ID.3 somewhere close to these two.

"The obvious BEV candidate that may have achieved more German sales in September is the Volkswagen ID.3. We know that the newcomer scored a strong 1989 unit sales in Norway in September. Could the ID.3 have garnered over 3,600 unit sales in the homeland? It seems very possible, but we don’t yet have any solid data one way or another.

What we can say is that the Renault ZOE scored 3,600 sales, the Tesla Model 3 got close to 3,000 sales, and the VW ID.3 probably got close to these two, if not higher. Other recent favourite BEVs in Germany have reliably included the VW e-Golf; Hyundai Kona; VW e-Up!; Audi e-tron; Smart Fortwo; and BMW i3. The VW e-Golf still likely has some inventory to move, but will obviously soon bow out to the VW ID.3. All the other recent favourites will likely have made good sales in September as usual."



Again, competition is coming. It's very real and it's taking away market share from Tesla.|

yesterday•Last reply yesterday| Why Tesla will remain 10+ years ahead of the curve.
The problem with current car manufacturers is it takes them years to make changes to a PART due to the structure of how decisions are made in the company and how those parts are dependent on outside companies to decide and eventually make the changes. So a typical car part will approximately take 5 to 6 years to be updated because it has to go thru a board and decided on which 80% of ideas die if it did succeed and submitted to the car parts manufacturer and they also have to decide if it is worth for them to make those changes as they also have other car customers to deal with. So even if they stream line the company decision making process they still have to deal with the manufacturer. Tesla based on the changes experts have seen in all their past cars only takes approximately 6 months to change a part because it is vertically integrated. Currrently there are no car companies who can make changes to a part in 6 months.|

2 days ago•Last reply yesterday| Bond yields are rising today. This probably isn't a big deal given how low yields are, but if yields rise substantially (and they may if there is market/election turmoil), then the markets are likely to come down with bonds.

One thesis is that all of this easy money will allow governments to subsidize EVs and prop up markets, but there are growing cracks in that story. Tesla is dramatically reliant on people who feel good about their finances and thankful for government incentives to continue selling a lot of cars.

After the election, some leader will have to reacquaint themselves with the tax system that is unable to cover the cost of running the USA. The same is true for Europe, where countries like Italy may simply be unable to pay their bills soon (it would have been more obvious without COVID, but still... they're broke).

And China's growth rate is down to 3.2%! Pundits have long suggested they need 7% just to stave off social unrest. What's next? I don't know, but the cracks are starting to show in the consumption based economy and luxury goods (like Tesla) often suffer lower demand during downturns.

Not saying that will happen now, or next week, but after the election there is likely going to be a reckoning of some sort.

Depending on how the numbers look and if they revise their full year numbers down then it could be a sharp decline. If they keep the delivery numbers for the year then 470 should be the turning point. It will not go to 500 and above, not on an election month!|

1. 139,300 vehicles sold at $53,000 ASP. (ASP last quarter was $56,980 ex. Regulatory Credits)
2. 20% gross margin (last quarter was 18.4% GM ex. Regulatory Credits)
3. $400MM for energy gen/storage
4. $500MM for service & other
5. Loss of 10MM on these two aspects of the business. They lost 50MM here last quarter.
6. $375MM for R&D (R&D was really light last quarter, expect a return to spending, given the raise)
7. $700 for SG&A given the two factories under construction and increased sales
8. $170MM for interest expense (I didn't look at changes to the balance sheet for changes to debt)
9. $25MM for other expenses (This is just a guess).

That leaves $207MM for retained earnings. Of course if any regulatory credits are brought into revenue, then the number will increase proportionately.

Any other guesses?

2 days ago•Last reply 2 days ago| I keep wondering real motive behind Tesla Battery day since I saw on that day.

First most of stuff look so simple and obious that it's not really break though and any expert would have thought and tried.

My biggest wonder is, we know Toyota, VW, BMW, GM, Mercedes all claiming they have Solid State battery technology. I don't think Tesla taking it lightly. They either contract with same company (Like QuantrumScape or some other) But mean time coming up with new way to use old battery chemistry just to inflate stock while powerful people book profit and exit.

Toyota already have prototype and road map for solid state battery. Mercedes giving solid state battery option to their Bus in production vehicle. VW claiming 2025 for mass production..

So Elon can come out in 2023 or 2024 saying Solid State battery technology come long way in last few years and it does not make sense to persue this battery pack and so changing plan and then create another hoax to replace it.

Amazing if market continue buy all those Hoax one after another with very clear motive. I don't care if those convertible holder lose everything because they deserve to lose but in real world, those convertible holder are most powerful group out there and THey going to bring down many many different stock to ground as soon as they start hedging again while minting billions after billions and getting even powerful.

Remember most powerful bear group is convertible holder and be careful.|

So, why would I want someone who is clearly not pro EV running my country? Did you hear what he said? Hardly bullish, while he did offer subsidies which I'm sure anyone in his position would do by default. He tried to justify the continuation of ICE vehicles stating that EVs hardly make a difference.

Tesla is extremely overvalued and it will take a long time for it to prove its worth. However in a market with no growth, 0 interest rate and high liquidity; big funds don't have too much reason to take their money out. Meanwhile they are just gonna pump and dump this stock and keep selling options.|
2 days ago| I usually don’t look at forums specifically because of the conversations you see here.

Anyways, I missed the first train to millions with tesla. I recently bought in 36 shares at 400$. (Its all I could afford without effecting any other finances and still being comfortable).

For those of you newer here than I am, i’ve noticed tesla has crazy swings and it’s pretty exciting watching your money fluctuate. I could imagine the anxiety for people with much more shares than I have.

I’m here for the long haul and hopefully for the positive side of the outcome. We may lose some days but ultimately I think I made the right “investment” no matter how many of these trolls and shorties say otherwise!

What are your thoughts on Elon Musk? 12 trauches of compensation.
According to my estimates he will end up with over 100 million more shares creating more dillution. On top of the 3-5% share dillution currently. at the current nose bleed market cap right now there dilution rates are almost equal to there revenue. Ok by next year tsla will probably bring in around 52 - 55 billion in revenue if all goes as planned. Still at 8 x next years salses is very very high for a auto company!
Last time I checked tsla revenues 85% came from selling cars!
That makes them a auto company!
Plus they buy there batteries from other companies.
Eventually they will produce there own batteries.
Eventually there competitors will also produce there own batteries.
Do you really think Germany is going to stand buy and let tesla dominate them. I don't think so. Look at world war 2 germans are fighters! VW and Toyota will contiue to dominate the markets not to mention Gm, F etc.
competitiion is coming in the next 1 or 2 and they will be able to compete with tsla.

All of the tesla profits are coming from ev credits!

139,300 for the quarter puts the number around 9.2 - 9.3 billion in revenue!
Yes, that's a beat but with the current market cap, I would say the current price more then justifies that beat!

9 days ago•Last reply 2 days ago| Forecast: NIO will soon enter into new all time highs. Higher 20s and lower 30s are within the reach based on valuation. This is based on recent developments, production forecast, ER forecast, growing demand etc. NIO will play a very big role in China's EV growth and lead in many ways. In short term price can be manipulated, fluctuate due to many reasons but long term players will be the real winners. According to the forecast NIO will show it's potential in Q4 which could be the start of market "disruption" in China. My analysis also shows that NIO could be the first manufacturer to bring Level 5 autonomous driving car to consumers not Tesla with the help of Mobileye. Sandy Munro is getting amused by Tesla's grade 12 battery day presentation and talks highly about autonomous driving circuit board, obviously he hasn't pulled out a circuit board of computer or server. Wall Street was pumping Tesla saying it has the greatest autonomous driving software but Elon Musk revealed on battery day that they had to rewrite the whole program from scratch. If Tesla can rewrite autonomous driving software then brands like NIO and VW group can write a new program. However working together with Mobileye and sharing data is the best way to take autonomous driving to the next level as there have to be common protocols to be followed when it comes to CONNECTED CARS. NIO recently hired someone with magic hands to develop it's own autonomous driving software. So what's the biggest issue with Tesla's battery day? Tesla hasn't created a new battery technology, it has redesigned its own battery cell. This is is not a new idea. We all know very low power consumption devices use AAA batteries and high power consumption devices use batteries like AA, LR14 LR20 etc in normal household devices. The battery technology that we have today will change in future, chemicals in them will change to make EV more safer, so by the time Tesla get to where it's planning to get competitors will unleash some amazing solutions and technology. NIO is safe in every way because of battery swap technology. Blue Sky coming! Just believe in it. $tsla $xpeng $li|

September Sales (2020) 18,522; (2019) 19290; (4% drop in sales)
Q3 Sales (2020) 30,081; (2019) 26,786 (12% increase in sales)
YTD Sales (2020) 64400; (2019) 75648 (14.9% drop in sales)

For the YTD number, COVID is clearly having an impact, but September shows what happens when the competition enters the market. The PoleStar started selling at the end of August and the ID.3 delivered their first vehicles in the last days of August as well.

Competition is coming.

2 days ago| Lots of things I want to say about Tesla.

Lets start with self driving.

For this this to work reliably in most weather conditions, I think that some form of vehicle to vehicle communication would be mandatory. There would also be a need for some sort of beacon system for disabled vehicles, lane obstructions, or similar hazards that could not be reliably detected. All manufacturers would need to be on board, and any local authority that allowed autonomous driving would need to make sure that all authorized routes within their jurisdiction met certain standards.

This will take time, which will allow autopilot will improve, and eventually we will be able to legally and safely sleep behind the wheel on restricted access roads like interstates. At that point, I can see paying Elon's car to drive me from interchange A to interchange B so that I can avoid the most boring part of my trip.

As far as the current plan is concerned (revenue from self driving on unrestricted highways, roads, interchanges, residential streets, and the like), It's going to be a long time before it's technically, logistically, and legally possible.|

He knows his record is so ugly the last couple of years by constantly rating Ford and JM a buy and Tesla a sell. He knows he lost his credit so if he comes out with another sell rating he will be humiliated by the market again. So he changed a strategy by saying he is raising Tesla's target to catch eye balls to show his true bearish color.
But IMO no matter how many ways he tries he can not change the fact the Tesla is new industrial revolution company and accelerating.

Oh by the way JP Morgan also recommends Nikola as a buy. lol. So it seems JP Morgan is not only trying to save GM and Ford. As long as it is anti-Tesla they recommended it (enemy's enemy is friend?). Just as Jay Lano said "I don't understand why some people hate Tesla, it is doing great things".|

Note that even if we had not gotten the news of the Trump Covid, that TSLA , while likely to have been up today, it would not have been up hugely. It probably would have peaked around $455 or so and then sold off into the close modestly. The extremists would have been wrong even if no Trump covid. And the option expiration to look forward to is the oct 16 one, which is where most of the bigger players in options placed their bets rather than the weekly oct 2 and 9. And the LDV for that one is considerably lower than the current price. It is going to be interesting! ( as TSLA usually is)|

The company said it delivered 139,000 SUVs and sedans from July through September compared with 97,000 deliveries during the same period a year ago.

The sales outpaced Wall Street estimates. Analysts polled by data provider FactSet expected the company to sell 137,000 vehicles during the quarter.

Tesla could post its fifth straight profitable quarter when it releases third-quarter earnings later this month.|

A solar roof can generate enough electricity in one year for a household to run off the grid. If the electricity can be stored in a TSLA battery, it doesn't have to be thrown out, and all the houses connecting to the electrical grid can be self-sufficient and there will be little need for power generators anymore. Houses can transfer power to each other as-needed, and blackouts will be a thing of the distant past.|

Love to see the beautifully restored antique, vintage, rare, unique, custom, muscle and period cars.

As day to day transportation they are a NTSB nightmare. Their century old “beta” phase cost millions of lives. Seat belts, child safety seats, air bags, padded dash’s, electronic stability control, crumple zones, fire control design are just a few of the safety features included in the new cars.

3 days ago•Last reply 2 days ago| Just finished my Tesla test drive an hour ago. It’s hard to understand the company without driving the car first hand. The acceleration, efficiency, use,... were surprisingly disappointing.

I asked the salesman at the tesla dealership if I could take the model y SUV off the road.

With a lisp he said the model y is a "crothover' it has a hatchback, but you can't take it off road, it might damage the tablet duct taped to the dash". He continued, "the model X is our SUV".

I said "ok let"s take one of those out for an off road test drive".

He said, "you can't take our SUV off road, you'll void the warranty, the battery pack can't take the vibration and it could fail and burst into flames.".

I said "ok, what about the punk truck?"

He said "sorry, no can do the off road in that either".

He said teslas are for taking you boyfriend out for a weekend drive along the coast.

I said, "I don't go that wayliberace".

Overall, I was highly disappointed driving a Tesla for the first time.

Will be ordering a Ford F150 Hybrid with the off road package in December.

We're on trillions now. Millions and billions are Chump change. It is all a game. And if you know how to play it, you can make millions and billions. Are the airline employees now the chosen ones?

Pure nonsense. The media's goal in promulgating these fraudulent polls is to provide cover for the Dems planned mail-in voter fraud. Their hope is the Dems pull off the fraud and then they can point back to the bogus polls to say "Biden was always in the lead. Just go back and look at the polls."

"Since the outbreak began, the World Health Organization and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recommended that masks be reserved for medical workers, sick people and their caregivers — not worn by the general public."

Joe Biden's Response to Trump shutting down international travel:



"Stop the xenophobic fear-mongering. Be honest. Take responsibility. Do your job."

Biden called Trump's travel ban xenophobic so it's laughable that Democrats claim Biden would have handled this better, when in reality his attitude at the time shows a concerning lack of seriousness for the implications of an impending global pandemic.

Trump (not being in the medical field) followed the advice from the WHO (pro Chinese) and the CDC. Trump was told it would be no worse than the flu and he passed that info on to the American public. China wants Joe Biden for president because they believe Joe will allow the CCP to continue it’s military build up that is challenging America today. Trump is pushing back on China. TRUMP SAYS BUY AMERICAN. China’s military already has more Navy ships than we do and China says it wants to double or triple the number of nuclear weapons it has. (All of this can be found on youtube). Every time we spend a USD on something made in China about half of that dollar goes to China’s military build up. The U.S. experiment toward Democratic reform in Communist Red China has failed. This is why this election is so important. You have to look at the whole picture. America’s survival depends on it.

1) The arcane term “delivery” includes both leased vehicles and sold vehicles
2) TSLA DOES NOT include a “buy-out provision” to customers leasing a vehicles.
3) TSLA intends to employ lease returns as robo-taxies in an enormous robo-taxi fleet.
4) TSLA’s business model is to provide

1.) they have a brand new factory in China
2.) They added a new product - lower cost MIC Model 3
3.) Sales increased by 27,300 units

In other words - they spent about $1 billion and will be required to pay $ 323 million in taxes to Shangahi every year (starting in 2023) for a net 10,000 units per month.

Just to be clear the initial wave of demand for the MIC Model 3 might be sustainable or might not. The multiple price cuts suggest Tesla is seeing demand wane for the Model 3 in China.|

3 days ago•Last reply 3 days ago| The average life of a ICE vehicle is 8 to 12 years depending on its quality, use, reliability and care. Simpler EVs, which will last much longer will dramatically change that dynamic. Every new BEV (or used) sold replaces an ICE one. Exponential growth of electric cars manufactured will exponentially overtake the fossil fueled conveyances. The nearly one and a half billion ICE cars on the road today (and their supporting infrastructure) are going to be retired much sooner than later. Because of many factors the new and used ICE cars will have less and less value. The cruise lines, hammered by the pandemic, are earlier starting to scrap more and more of their older liners. Same with the airline’s planes and big container/tanker shipping industry. They will go for pennies on the pound. The entire recycling industry will be swamped. Old ICE vehicles will soon clutter the entire planet. Investors are realizing this as TSLA’s market cap vaults.|

BMW expects FCEV to be cheaper than BEVs in 2025, Honda is aggressively working on their tech and dozens of others are in process as well. Then I read this little nugget from Germany. Nowhere near ready for production, but a 2 seater car for 15,000? Fuel cell with a small battery backup. Pretty interesting concept.

Perhaps all of that battery development (storage) will benefit fuel cells (generation), but if you have zero emissions generation at lower weight . . . what is that trade off?

That is exactly what William Li does. This gives him and his team more flexibility, lower costs and makes aggressive expansions like we are witnessing with nio possible. And I’m sure the market has already recognized that fact. I would love, if $NIO would today announce that they are building a NIO house in every greater German City, our country is small and the Germans will love $NIO.

Heck, look at S. Korea Seoul. 15MIL people living in Seoul and 98% is apartment/codo...and Japan too. Therefore $tsla needs to change to BAAS inorder to compete with NIO. PLus, taxis service in China can buy NIO due to lack of charging or waiting...because to them every minute is money.|
5 days ago•Last reply 3 days ago| Don't listen to the analysts people. Quarter results were impeccable. The company keeps taking market share, and is 2 years out from having vehicles that out compete even the cheapest ICE engines. Additionally, as their tech develops they will lead the world in so many other facets, eventually they will have 10's of billion dollar revenue streams from Auto, Autonomous Driving, AI, Energy storage, Energy production(Solar), Manufacturing tech licensing(Sell designs and tech for new age manufacturing), Battery applications, mining and so much more. Remember Elon has access to some of the leading tech companies in the world Space X and Tesla, of which he is chief Engineer, he can take applications from both business and apply where they fit. It is hard to imagine that there will be companies out their that could keep up with Teslas pace of innovation.

It is my honor to quote from one of the greatest inventors of all time, Nikola Tesla - “Peace can only come as a natural consequence of universal enlightenment and merging of races, and we are still far from this blissful realization. All that was great in the past was ridiculed, condemned, combated, suppressed — only to emerge all the more powerfully, all the more triumphantly from the struggle. Let the future tell the truth, and evaluate each one according to his work and accomplishments. The present is theirs; the future, for which I have really worked, is mine. Our virtues and our failings are inseparable, like force and matter. When they separate, man is no more”. Keep up your good work!|

4 days ago•Last reply 4 days ago| Can anyone explain how the arcane term “deliveries” can be considered a proxy for “sales.”

We all know TSLA lumps both SALES and LEASES into the “transfer of possession” category mysteriously titled “deliveries.”

This is where TSLA’s no dealership business model falls short of the
mark. The traditional dealership takes title when the dealer takes possession, then the dealer sells or leases the car to customers. Lessees are invariably given a “buy-out provision” to purchase the car when the lease expires. TSLA has specifically rejected offering the “standard buy-out provision.” The TSLA business model calls for the hundreds of thousands of LEASE RETURNS to comprise a massive ROBO-TAXI FLEET to service a growing need for Robo-Taxi passengers———-

IMHO the TSLA business model is an enormous “bet on the come.” I don’t see a very high likelihood for success

Stay safe, be careful———|

Very possible he'll use the opportunity to continue downplaying & encourage his supporters to go out & vote in person, & then once votes come in, suppress & prevent counting of mailed in ballots w/lawsuits across all 50 states, pushing the SCOTUS w/the new justice, to decide.

4 days ago| I’m surprised about the number of TSLA/Musk loyal followers. These folks have attributes considered cultish by many reasonable people in the investment community. Whereas I fully expect to see EVs to gain increasing market share, I expect that increased market share to be distributed over a vastly increased number of EV market participants, I.e., nearly all the legacy have EVs either in production or nearing the production stage.

$350 Billion market capitalization is beyond the pale for an auto manufacturer in business for 17 years and still w/out auto sales revenue.

This is a case of the company financing operations with secondary offerings of new shares ($5 billion secondary recently, and the $2 billion secondary earlier this year.)

TSLA/Musk loyalists continue to feed this unsustainable Juggernaut.....there will be a day of reckoning IMHO. At the same time I strongly advise against initiating a short sale of this vastly overvalued equity.

In house floor traders, with very, very, deep pockets view all short sellers as sitting ducks. Easy targets to force the short seller to cover at an even more inflated share price.

Be careful, we will see a correction with this behemoth.....the question is when...story stocks like TSLA can remain overvalued for longer than you would expect|

I don't think Tesla has had a major recall since 2017. I wonder what happens if all of their suspension systems had to be replaced, without a dealer network to accommodate these failures?

Does anyone have any insight on how the company has explained how such an occurrence would be handled?

4 days ago| Tesla spent about $1.4 billion on R&D in 2019. I would expect that number will be closer to $2 billion this year. But for those who are interested in the R&D budgets of car companies, here is a chart from Statista with the sobering reality of how that $2 billion stacks up.

.

I haven't looked for all of the data but GM spent 6.8 Billion in 2019. Toyota in 2018 spent about $10 billion. VW in 2017, spent $17 billion on R&D. So before you get too hyped up about advances being made by ANY company in the battery space, just recognize that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and a lot of companies can easily imitate Tesla now. Some will then leapfrog them. It's the nature of industry.

4 days ago•Last reply 4 days ago| Yesterday there was an interesting post about Tesla entering the Indian market. This is exciting news to be sure.

Currently, India's average car sells for 7.7 Lakh or about 770,000 rupees. That is about 10,500 dollars. In 2019, there were approximately 3MM cars, trucks and SUVs sold in all of India.

The luxury car market is where Tesla would show up, 2019 saw the purchase of about 36,000 luxury vehicles in the entire country, for the entire year. Mercedes sells about 50% of those, BMW about 30% and VW/Audi about 20%.

Undoubtedly if Tesla were to enter the Indian car market, they would sell a lot of cars. People with high disposable incomes are often the first to switch to greener options. Let's assume they took over half of the luxury car market . . . that would be about 18,000 cars.

It's not a HUGE market when Tesla is trying to get to 1MM cars in 2022. In fact, it may just be a distraction.

Two other points to make
(1) even if Tesla were to come out with a $25,000 car, that would still be 250% more expensive than the average car in India (Suzuki has about 50% share of the entire market, and Hindustan and Tata (JLR) are also big names there.
(2) India's power grid is fraught with problems and needs massive investment, but India is renowned for their disparate and divisive politics where things just don't get done.

I hope that helps those who are thinking entry to India is going to really goose demand . . . with Tesla's production at 500,000 cars a year (average price $50,000), its not likely to be meaningful, particularly when China and the EU have very strong incentives. Wuling would be a better bet in India.

By Corky Siemaszko
Covid-19 spread from China, but much of the "infodemic" is coming from the White House.

According to a new study from Cornell University, President Donald Trump is the world’s biggest spreader of coronavirus misinformation.

Nearly 38 percent of the “misinformation conversation” began with Trump doing things such as promoting unproven “miracle cures” for Covid-19 or claiming with zero evidence that the pandemic was a “Democratic Party hoax” aimed at derailing his presidency, the researchers from the Cornell Alliance for Science found.

Talk like that is dangerous, alliance Director Sarah Evanega said.

“We were interested in exploring this issue because the World Health Organization has identified COVID misinformation, which is dubbed an ‘infodemic,’ as a serious concern in fighting the pandemic,” she said. “If people are misled by unscientific and unsubstantiated claims about the disease, they may be less likely to observe official guidance and thus risk spreading the disease.”

In other coronavirus developments:

Cruise ships will be barred from sailing in U.S. waters for at least another month, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Nearly 3,700 confirmed or suspected cases of Covid-19 on cruise ships in the United States have been reported to the CDC since March 1 and at least 41 people died, the agency said.
Around 837,000 people filed for first-time jobless benefits last week as the pandemic-battered U.S. economy continued to struggle. The unemployment rate was 4.8 percent when Trump took office in January 2017. It’s 8.4 percent now.
Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves announced he would not extend his mask-wearing mandate even though his state has the fourth-highest rate of new infections in the country with 17.8 percent, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Research Center. "We should not use the heavy hand of government more than it is justified," Reeves said.
Hospitals in the parts of Wisconsin where the number of coronavirus cases have recently spiked are running out of beds for patients. In Green Bay, where Trump on Saturday is supposed to hold a campaign rally, Bellin Hospital was reportedly already at 94 percent capacity. Wisconsin right now is the state with the third-highest rate of new infections with 21.14 percent, according to Johns Hopkins.
White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said Trump has no plan to cancel the Green Bay rally, even though Wisconsin's governor has urged the president to reconsider. "Yeah, so the president believes that people have a first amendment right to political speech," McEnany said. "He is having a rally. People can choose whether or not to come.
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican who has gotten bipartisan praise for aggressively attacking the pandemic, reported that for the first time in 187 days the state recorded "zero new Covid-19 deaths."
A Pennsylvania federal appeals court said Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, can resume enforcing size limits on gatherings while it appeals an earlier lower court ruling by a Trump-appointed federal judge who threw out statewide crowd size limits and other measures aimed at stopping the virus from spreading.
New York, which was once the nation's hot spot, reported more than 1,300 new cases on Thursday. That is the most since May. While the state continues to maintain a less than two percent infection rate, clusters of new Covid-19 cases have been reported in Brooklyn, Queens and Rockland County. People in New York City who refuse to don masks could be hit with fines of up to $1,000.
The Cornell study, released Thursday, appears to be the first comprehensive look at pandemic misinformation in the media, and the researchers reached their conclusions after using a content aggregator to analyze 38 million Covid-19 articles from English-language news outlets around the world.

They found that Trump drove major misinformation ”spikes” when he talked about using bleach to cure Covid-19 or when he advocated unproven treatments like hydroxychloroquine.

Trump’s false claim about the pandemic being created by the "deep state" to install a “new world order” was also a big driver of misinformation. So was the president’s promotion of conspiracy theories that Covid-19 was a bio-weapon that was “intentionally or accidentally released by a laboratory in Wuhan, China.”

Much of Trump's false Covid-19 information was dispensed at his coronavirus press briefings, which he ditched in April after his advisers warned the|

They found that Trump drove major misinformation ”spikes” when he talked about using bleach to cure Covid-19 or when he advocated unproven treatments like hydroxychloroquine.

Trump’s false claim about the pandemic being created by the "deep state" to install a “new world order” was also a big driver of misinformation. So was the president’s promotion of conspiracy theories that Covid-19 was a bio-weapon that was “intentionally or accidentally released by a laboratory in Wuhan, China.”

Much of Trump's false Covid-19 information was dispensed at his coronavirus press briefings, which he ditched in April after his advisers warned the|

Tesla and other automakers need to ensure there is sufficient nickel available to produce the number of batteries required for EVs over the next 5-8 years, Mark Travers, Vale's executive director of base metals, tells Reuters.
Asked whether Vale and Tesla have held discussions, Travers said: "Yes, absolutely."
Vale is expanding its Voisey's Bay site in Labrador to an underground operation that will produce ~40K metric tons/year of nickel-in-concentrate.

BMO said it could be several years, if ever, before $TSLA gets its extraction tech to work -- Tesla still needs a dependable supply of lithium. $LAC could fulfill that need over the next decade, given they should be the #3 producer in the world by the mid 2020s.

By doing that you set retail and tesla for failure because now the swampy companies like goldman are saying that if its not 150 its a failure even thou it really is not. Do you copy my geeky friend?|

Trump could easily end up in Walter Reed hospital by Sunday if his pulsox (blood oxygen level) goes below 92. Seriously, he's been sick with symptoms for two days now, and they WILL put him in the hospital if he gets even a little worse. Pence will be temporarily handed the presidency under the 25th Amendment, and the world will freak out. Markets will open down a minimum of 5% on Monday. And it doesn't look like the White House is assuaging anyone's fears by being transparent. Which means he is SICK. I wouldn't hold ANYTHING long over the weekend, so hats off to you. You're either really brave or really stupid.|

29 days ago•Last reply 5 days ago| Wise advice from Daniel Schönberger. "I know that me claiming Tesla being (absurdly) overvalued and that the stock is a gigantic bubble will lead to a lot of headwind and controversy and people telling me that I also don't get it (like all these other old school investors). Be that as it may, Tesla is a textbook example of a bubble. We don't even have to know what Tesla does or how it makes money.Tesla in September 2020. How do you justify a 1,000% increase within 12 months? What happened? What changed? I know the reasons, which are usually brought forward. When having a P/E ratio above 1,000 (taking the trailing 12 months earnings per share) and a price/sales ratio above 15, almost nobody is arguing with fundamental aspects anymore. I can't even imagine what has to happen for a large cap company to justify such increases. It is often claimed that people are just waking up and are finally understanding Tesla. Really? Millions of investors and thousands of analysts took several years to understand Tesla. And they were not just wrong a little bit about the true value of the company, the true value of the stock is more than ten times higher as analysts previously estimated?""|

Their product demand isn't great and Elon forced to lower prices lately to keep demand. There is still good demand but it's at risk to go out of balance very fast and very quickly.|

5 days ago•Last reply 5 days ago| The ratings by the EU are actually inaccurate. They claim that the Tesla name of auto-pilot can be misleading - well, depends on if you are intelligent or not. Further, their claim that the Tesla Model 3 auto pilot completely disengages when the driver takes over - THAT'S WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO. Would you really want your cruise control to NOT disengage when you hit the brake? When the driver wrests control of the steering wheel from the system, it absolutely does what it is supposed to do. GIVE CONTROL TO THE DRIVER.

The rating was unfair and quickly exposes their bias.
Disclaimer: I've driven the Tesla Model 3 and found it to be exactly as expected.

5 days ago| Honda to stop racing F1 to focus on zero emission vehicles . . . hmmm. Buried in this Reuters story is Honda plans for 2/3 of their vehicle deliveries to be 'new energy vehicles' by 2030 (that would be 3.5MM vehicles) and Toyota is expecting their electric vehicle deliveries to reach 5.5MM in 2025.

VW is also expecting a few million by then.

To frame this effectively, Tesla may (MAY) have the capacity to build 2, perhaps 3MM vehicles by 2025. Likely 5 or perhaps 6 models.

I can't tell you how it will all work out, but I can tell you that competition is coming.

We know they have 25K capacity for Model X/S and demand only 15K so they loss 10K capacity ideal there.

That come to Model 3 /Y demand /supply question. Most important as it's cheapest model.
China capacity is 200K/year =50k 3 month ago and was expanding still. But let's say it's still same.
USA Capacity: 400K/year =100K

Total capacity is 175K and they produced 145K , 10 K clearly due to lower demand for model S and X which expected by all.
But 20K for lower demand for Model 3/Y even if we say they loss 5% capacity for any reason we talking 10K lower demand still.|

5 days ago•Last reply 5 days ago| Given the numbers that Tesla reported, this should be down by 50%, so it is actually holding up well. Here is why I think it should be down much more. Record production at Fremont was about 105k in 4Q2019. With two factories, record production is now 145k. If we assume that Fremont was still able to produce 105k, then Shanghai only produced 40k in the quarter, which is just over 3k per week. That would mean that the maximum production capacity of Shanghai is 160k per year, not the 200k that Tesla has claimed. It also means that Tesla's overall capacity is less than 600k per year with two factories. Musk said, back in 2017, that investors should have zero doubt that they would be able to produce 10k Model 3s per week by the end of 2018. Not only was that not true, but it is still not true. Tesla was able to make 128k this quarter, but with two factories and including the Model Ys. Now in order to hit 500k, Tesla will need to deliver just over 180k in 4Q2020. Is that possible? The simple answer is no. They cannot produce that many vehicles, so they cannot deliver that many.

Musk also said that new vehicle inventory was declining. So let's look at the numbers. Total production from 1Q2018 to 2Q2020 was 804724 and total deliveries in that period was 791170. That is a difference of 13554. Now we know that Tesla just added about 6k to that total, raising it to almost 20k. That is 20k more cars that were made than were sold. Tesla stopped reporting in transit numbers more than a year ago. I suspect that was so that they could include those in their delivery numbers. But giving them the benefit of the doubt, let's say they do not. In the past, the in transit numbers have been as high as 10k. So for Musk's statement to be true, they would need more than 6k in transit at the moment, which is actually reasonable. But unless they are able to make 160k vehicles this quarter and sell every single car in inventory, it will be impossible for Tesla to reach 500k deliveries. 500k in a year. Other automakers that are valued five to ten times lower than Tesla can do that in less than a month. Biggest bubble ever.|

3TWH from about 50 GWH (2019) is a 60X in battery manufacturing in next 10 years
if that isnt an indication of 60X growth being planned, I dont know what is

"Meanwhile, Tesla (TSLA) reported Q3 deliveries of 139,300 vehicles, a new record high that topped analysts' downgraded estimates of 137,000."

So GM performed worse than Ford and yet GM is up 1.6% and Tesla is sown 5%, ha ha ha.|

5 days ago| TSLA is likely to crash hard before it makes new gains anywhere close to the last year.

There is little room for a justified - thus lasting - upside in the next few months and even years. On the other hand, even if there were no bad news specific to Tesla in that time, such a volatile and overpriced stock is due to fall badly should the market as a whole retreat.

And there are still plenty of risks today that could cause a general crash, from COVID to the election to international tensions, on top of older issues as ever increasing inequality and a stock market that's becoming ever mode speculative and unstable which may call for further regulation.

Mid term, let's say up to 2 or 3 years, I don't think Tesla is at all a safe place to store money. Best to take the eventual gains and eventually wait for a better entry point, a significantly lower one. IMHO of course.|

2020 will be a boom year:
1) They entered in the HAND SANITIZERS sector with huge margins;
2) ELECTRIC CARS requires dense biofuel to produce electricity in high volumes on board!

I guess that AMTX and PEIX are the perfect fits to do partnership with electric cars producers like Tesla, Nikola,...

For example, Nissan e-bio van uses 8 gallon ethanol tanks to fuel hydrogen fuel cell to provide 400 mile range

- High power, long range electric vehicles requires energy dense, storable, transportable fuel.

ELECTRIC CARS will need ethanol fuel cells for power and range!

Piper Sandler expects Tesla's energy business to reach more than $200 billion per year in revenue.

“We anticipate sharply higher demand for these products, particularly in the late 2020s and 2030s as renewable energy grows toward 40% of electricity generation,” the analyst said.

Tesla Energy represented $1.5 billion in revenue for the company in fiscal 2019.

In fiscal 2023, the analyst projects that Tesla Energy will hit $12.4 billion in revenue — and cross $200 billion by 2033.

Tesla will control over one-third of the market for stationary batteries, he said, adding that Tesla management has previously stated that the segment will generate as much as Tesla's automotive operations.|

5 days ago| PALO ALTO, Calif., Oct. 02, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In the third quarter, we produced just over 145,000 vehicles and delivered nearly 140,000 vehicles.

Production Deliveries Subject to operating lease accounting
Model S/X 16,992 15,200 13%
Model 3/Y 128,044 124,100 7%
Total 145,036 139,300 7%
In terms of days of sales, new vehicle inventory declined further in Q3 as we continue to improve our delivery efficiency.

Our net income and cash flow results will be announced along with the rest of our financial performance when we announce Q3 earnings. Our delivery count should be viewed as slightly conservative, as we only count a car as delivered if it is transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct. Final numbers could vary by up to 0.5% or more. Tesla vehicle deliveries represent only one measure of the company’s financial performance and should not be relied on as an indicator of quarterly financial results, which depend on a variety of factors, including the cost of sales, foreign exchange movements and mix of directly leased vehicles.|

They do start with very large inventory and so while demand still better than supply, it much closer to balance and very soon can go downward. When balance, they have to spend signficant on promotion and when downward they are just typical other automaker where cost per car increase while sale per price decrease and also forced to sell though dealership.

I thought it might happen in 2021 late half but given soft china demand after only 6 month of factory and how much inventory left unsold telling me that This might start around April /May next year.

TSLA will rise up to 470 and then could fall back to about 420 by October 9th before going back up to 505 - 510 on or about 15th October. Just my analysis based on what I have observed since TSLA started trading.|
5 days ago| Someone decided to mock the Sweden and Norway data. You shouldn't. Sales are down pretty dramatically in these two (tiny) countries.

The data suggests that when the big boys come out to play that Tesla's sales decline, in these markets at least. The question is will it continue as the competition expands in the rest of the world.

In Sweden
- M/M Sales are up 1058 vs. 1002 or +5.5% for September
- Q/Q Sales are down 1902 vs. 1307 or -31% for Q3
- YTD Sales are down 3686 vs. 4848 or -24% for 9 months

Norway saw a dramatic drop however. 1439 vs. 2762 or down 48%
- M/M Sales are down 1439 vs. 2762 or - 48% for September
- Q/Q Sales are down 1821 vs. 4084 or - 56% for Q3
- YTD Sales are down 3903 vs. 16,609 or -77% for 9 months

You can be a blind optimist, but that doesn't change the data. These two tiny countries may not be representative, but they are 'mature' markets for EVs and so may represent the future.

When Germany and UK are announced they will provide a lot more insight as they are much larger markets.

5 days ago•Last reply 5 days ago| Tesla will have zero sales in China by 2030: analyst
Daniel HowleyTechnology Editor
,Yahoo Finance•October 1, 2020

Tesla (TSLA) may not have much of a future in the world’s largest electric vehicle market, if one analyst’s predictions pan out. Morgan Stanley’s (MS) Adam Jonas says that CEO Elon Musk’s high-tech automotive company will likely see sales in China plummet to zero by 2030.

“We have China sales peaking [in the] middle of the decade and then going down...and then eventually nothing after 2030,” Jonas told Yahoo Finance’s “On the Move” this week.

China has become an important market for Tesla, since Musk worked with the country’s government to build out the firm’s Shanghai Gigafactory. The country has the fastest growing EV market in the world, but saw sales dip last year as Beijing began to phase out government subsidies for alternative energy vehicles with the expectation of ending them in 2020.

Yahoo Finance newsletter.
Yahoo Finance newsletter.

Tesla, which doubled its sales in China in the first half of 2020, controls 21% of that country’s EV market, Nikkei Asia reported in August, citing Chinese research firm Ways. That was up from 6% the year prior. But it also comes as Chinese EV sales tumbled by roughly half, according to the report.

In March, the country extended those subsidies, and in April decided that the subsidies would run until 2022 in an effort to prop up sales of EVs and reach a self-imposed goal of alternative energy vehicles accounting for a fifth of all vehicles sales by 2025.

So why then does Jonas believe Tesla’s sales in China will fall off a cliff by 2030? It all has to do with the company’s hopes for autonomous vehicle systems and the impact of the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China.

With data privacy and security between U.S. and Chinese tech companies top of mind, Jonas said, it’s unlikely the U.S. would allow a network of Chinese-made autonomous vehicles to drive around any major U.S. city in the future. Naturally, the flip side would also be true.

“Can you imagine a Chinese internet of cars autonomous network operating in the streets of Boston in 10 years? Of course not. Wake up. It's not happening,” he said.

“And so this idea that the Chinese aren't allowed to use AI network machine learning data privacy networks from the state, but it's okay for us to do [it] there, is just a fallacy in our opinion,” Jonas added.

While Jonas noted that Tesla might be able to own a stake in an EV Chinese entity, he said that there are still too many unknowns when it comes to how much Chinese and U.S. companies will be allowed to interface with each others’ countries in the future.

Tesla’s stock has been on a tear in 2020, with retail investors largely seen as a major catalyst for its rise from $93.81 at the start of the year to $448.16 as of the close of markets on Oct. 1.

Recently, the company hosted its annual Battery Day event, where Musk announced plans for a new vehicle with a starting price of $25,000 that will be available in three years, something he’s promised in the past. That would be a significant price drop from the current Model 3, which starts at $37,990 before incentives. The company also discussed plans to mine its own lithium.|

In terms of days of sales, new vehicle inventory declined further in Q3 as we continue to improve our delivery efficiency.
Our net income and cash flow results will be announced along with the rest of our financial performance when we announce Q3 earnings. Our delivery count should be viewed as slightly conservative, as we only count a car as delivered if it is transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct. Final numbers could vary by up to 0.5% or more. Tesla vehicle deliveries represent only one measure of the company’s financial performance and should not be relied on as an indicator of quarterly financial results, which depend on a variety of factors, including the cost of sales, foreign exchange movements and mix of directly leased vehicles.|

IF the stock is above $500 tuesday morning could go either way (keep in mind that TSLA's PE is over 1000 and all that is needed is the slightest doubt and the stock will slip $50-$100 just like that !, But if the stock is below $450 tuesday morning (opening at approximately 4:00am) It will most likely climb into the battery day presentation (about 2-2:30pm ... which takes place just after after the general shareholders meeting).|

Trump is not perfect (Only God is) and God has used imperfect people in the Bible to fore fill his will. BUT Trump has embraced Gods word and he has put God in front of everything while the Democrats want to hide God from public view. Religious freedom will be under attack if the Democrats win.

Let's pray to to help us focus on the moment while at the same time knowing we cannot capture that moment, we are in a flow of moments we let flow. We can watch moments in detail without being attached to them. Non-attachment to past & future stems from this practice. Worry about past or future is wasted energy, however we can observe the past & learn from it without agonising over it & trust ourselves to handle the future better. We can celebrate the opportunity to grow as we gain understanding from observation & experience. We can watch ourselves & avoid being caught up in over-reactions. Let's pray for a swift recovery of our POTUS & FLOTUS!!|

Even worse, the white house is refusing to tell anyone if he has symptoms or not, so you know he does, otherwise they'd be out there bragging, "see, it's no worse than the flu!".

7 days ago| TSLA pandemic special - Tesla has never turned a full year profit. Indeed, it has only managed four profitable quarters in its entire existence, surviving on revenue from California’s EV credit scheme and oceans of debt. So it is perhaps not surprising to see Tesla on the hunt for more government subsidies to keep it afloat. However many people, having grown accustom to headlines about GMs solid vehicle sales in recent years, may not realize that they too are not paying any federal corporate taxes.|

5 days ago| Really, once Tesla can mass produce a $25000 fully autonomious and reasonably practical car, with a range of 500 + miles, while would you buy another car unless you have special needs ( probably less than 30% of car owners)?
And when Elon says, thats just 3 years away, we give it an additional year.

So at most 5 years from now, not only Tesla has the capacicty to produce more than 2 millions vehicles/year(they have fully optimised their manufacturing and added more factories in more locations) but they will also be able to reinvest and build more Gigafactories around the world and meet a good chunk of new cars demand. 5 years is what i think it will take to propel $Tsla beyond $4000 whiteout ever looking back.|

5 days ago| What Tesla really needs to do to re-ignite its growth engine is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for Tesla (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if Tesla just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.

Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon. Read our last analysis and you’ll see.|

I have never thought of any American made cars like GM or F...which stands for "Grabage cars and Makers". Outside of US, Korea, Japan, and maybe in China...only the poor people drive Ford or GM vehicles.
Anyway, the mainstream medias get paid by the OLD boys of vehicle and they spend so much money to bring down EV sectors wanting and willing to see them crumble becasue 1. old OEMs still think that ICE will never be replaced. 2. The BODs don't and did not care for the future because they only care about their current salary. 3. They soon know that if they do not topple Tesla, they will be out of business soon.....so they pay mainstream media to "talk bad about EV market callling it the Bubble...it will never work....etc. BUT we all know the days are coming and is here for the Tesla and $nio will dominate the motor world moving forward while ICE Corp the old money will be extinct soon.

On the other hand if you don't work and not a student then you can get food benefits. Democrats made this kind of law to keep minorities not to work and stay in generational poverty!! If you don't believe me then look at the law yourself in Google or call your local welfare office. Ask them ” I am a student and I don't work due to study time, am I eligible for food stamps”. Their answer would be ”NO”|

WWJ NEWS

CATEGORIES: News Local News National News Politics
(WWJ) A pair of nationally-known conservative activists have been charged in a robocall scam aimed at suppressing the vote in the November general election.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has charged Jacob Wohl, of California, and Jack Burkman, of Virgina, with four felonies in connection with the calls that went out in late August, to around 12,000 voters in Detroit.

Listen Live Now on WWJ Newsradio 950
They warned residents that voting absentee would allow them to be targeted by police, credit card companies and even health departments for mandatory vaccines.

Wohl and Burkman have been behind a series of recent hoaxes, according to authorities, including paying actors to dupe the Washington Post into reporting that there was an FBI raid on Wohl's home, and paying a man to accuse Democratic Presidential Candidate Pete Buttagiej of sexual assault.

Nessel said Wohl and Burkman had the gall to use their own names on the robocalls, targeting urban voters.

"I honestly think that they've gotten away with so many things for so long, they thought that no one would do anything, and they thought it wouldn't matter," Nessel told WWJ's Sandra McNeill. "Why not advertise who's out there trying to interfere with people's right to vote?"

Burkman, 54, and Wohl, 22, are each charged with:

• One count of election law – intimidating voters, a five-year felony;
• One count of conspiracy to commit an election law violation, a five-year felony;
• One count of using a computer to commit the crime of election law – intimidating voters, a seven-year felony; and
• Using a computer to commit the crime of conspiracy, a seven-year felony.

The charges were filed Thursday n the 36th District Court in Detroit.

Arraignments are pending for both defendants.

“Any effort to interfere with, intimidate or intentionally mislead Michigan voters will be met with swift and severe consequences,” Nessel said. “This effort specifically targeted minority voters in an attempt to deter them from voting in the November election. We’re all well aware of the frustrations caused by the millions of nuisance robocalls flooding our cell phones and landlines each day, but this particular message poses grave consequences for our democracy and the principles upon which it was built. Michigan voters are entitled to a full, free and fair election in November and my office will not hesitate to pursue those who jeopardize that.”

The Attorney General encourages anyone in Michigan who received this call on or about Aug. 26 to contact her office by calling 517-335-7650.|

High quality competition is forcing them to cut tesla prices in China. And there is plenty of competition.
Nobody who is riding the wave cuts prices even once, never mind 3 times in one year. Just ask Apple.

Tesla appears to be hurting for sales growth in China. They have no choice but to cut prices and let the bottom line (that is "profit" for you Robinhooders) drop precipitously.|

Indeed, it has only managed four profitable quarters in its entire existence, surviving on revenue from California’s EV credit scheme and oceans of debt. So it is perhaps not surprising to see Tesla on the hunt for more government subsidies to keep it afloat. However many people, having grown accustom to headlines about GMs solid vehicle sales in recent years, may not realize that they too are not paying any federal corporate taxes.|

TSLA changed the status quo. Who would have thought the mammoth oil companies would become such losers, and their overbearing influence all but gone. A decade ago, big oil had all the dollars and everyone wanted to invest in it. Today, a beautiful green and peaceful world gets all the money, and everyone wants to invest in it. So, you're asking me, does the company that brought us to this day and intends to bring us to a much brighter future deserve a $450 billion market cap? I say, you betcha it deserves it and much much more.|

In addition to that he mentioned that Tesla will come out with a US$25,000 fully independent EV car for the wider market. Progressive thinking and a listening ear by the company CEO will translate into higher revenues and higher stock price in the future. I will go loooooooooong on this one.|

Tesla and production deliveries are ramping up. Teslas will be soon be ubiquitous across the nation and overseas. 7 out of 10 houses on my block have solar. This high growth will continue. Of course, California has 2nd the highest gas prices after Hawaii but the other states’ gas prices are steadily climbing. Long TSLA share holders are getting rich.

TSLA is futuristic world's leader in so many innovations and technology that will change our way of life and the lives of many future generations to come. Hold TSLA long minimum of 7 years that's how you'll increase your wealth significantly. people who trade TSLA and are in and out are losers, as they can't time TSLA"S dynamics and the many events and news that a growth company like TSLA have. people who short TSLA are the biggest losers as TSLA may have red days here and there but the TSLA trend is up and will continue for at least next 10 years. TSLA just started to grow and progress, its growth potential is the best growth story in the market. Don't listen to any Naysayers..Stay the course hold TSLA long. I think TSLA'S stock price can possibly reach $700 to $800 by year end. TSLA will experience few splits and continue the trend up as the company continues to grow and innovate.|

Guess what! They don't know, they know precious little. It is truly an example of the blind leading the blind.
Realize this, that there are big money interests that already know the numbers to be released .

Thanks to those (who politely) pointed out my bad sales data for Tesla Q3. I had a very clear error in my monthly table for China sales. This data is based on SEC filings, not monthly sales figures:

Q3 - 2019 - 97,186 delivered
Q3 - 2020 - 140-145,000 estimated.

That would be about 45% growth. Much better than my estimated 20% decline.

6 days ago•Last reply 6 days ago| Lets say by 2030, Tesla achieves 20 million cars sold a year (Elon's Estimate). That is currently 2019 Toyota's and Volkswagen's sales combined.... Tesla's market cap TODAY is already higher than both companies combined. But but what about the battery technology? 1) Its not Tesla's battery tech its actually a partnership with CATL ( a Chinese company look it up) 2) Making their own battery is the only way they could lower prices to 25k and thus able to sell 20 million. So the best case scenario by 2030 is already priced in, that's why the 1100+ P/E.|

6 days ago| "Race to the bottom dollar

The new price of the Shanghai-made Model 3 Standard Range Plus represents an 8% discount to the previously listed price of 271,550 yuan, or about $40,000. Tesla factors in Chinese government subsidies for electric vehicles (EVs) when it calculates the base price.

In the U.S., the base price for the Model 3 Standard Range Plus is $37,990, making the Chinese Model 3 slightly cheaper than the U.S. version. That's largely due to superior government incentives. U.S. federal tax credits for Tesla's EVs were phased out at the beginning of this year. However, Tesla's website claims that "potential incentives" could reduce the U.S. price even further."

Tesla referring to incentives coming under Joe Biden's $2 Trillion Green Plan for America (and Made in America).

Markets are starting to price in a Biden win. EV, solar stocks advancing.

Apparently, coal mining investment is not the way to go.|

Everyone in this cohort produce and manufacture except NKLA. Tesla has tech, battery, software and you name it. Nio has battery swap and upgrading their autopilot feature plug upgrading their manufacturikg facility. BYD is a battery company and created the blade battery for greater range performance. They sell many commercial electric vehicles and in the battery business. Xpeng may be a copycat of Tesla but they are a brand with products selling in both China and Europe. Li may be hybrid but at least they do manufacture their own vehicles and sell. Nikola is hoping to have GM because they have nothing. In the end, Nikola will be the next Tilray and they will bring GM down with them. ✌|

(excerpt from Teslerati article by Dacia J. Ferris)

"The decision to use a Tesla Model 3 as an official patrol vehicle for Bargersville Police Department in Indiana has proven to be a financial boon over the last 13 months it’s been in use. In a matchup against a Dodge Charger in their inventory, the all-electric sedan cost $6755 less in “fuel” and maintenance from August 2019 to August 2020. The Model 3’s performance and reliability overall has also been positive, and another Tesla may be added to the fleet next year as a result.

Todd Bertram, an officer with the Bargersville PD who has publicly discussed the department’s decision to purchase the Model 3 in recent months, posted the comparison data on his official Twitter account this week. As shown, the Dodge Charger ended up with maintenance and gas costs of $7580 while the Model 3 maintenance and electricity costs totaled $825 for the same time period."|

6 days ago| Tesla Inc's Autopilot has ranked sixth in 10 driver assistance systems evaluated in a European safety assessment, scoring low on its ability to keep drivers engaged.

The Tesla Model 3's Autopilot scored just 36 when assessed on its ability to maintain a driver's focus on the road. But it gained the highest marks for performance and ability to respond to emergencies, receiving an overall score of 131 and a rating of 'moderate'.

In contrast, the Mercedes GLE's system, which had the highest overall score of 174 and received the top rating of 'very good', received a score of 85 for driver engagement. Most other vehicles had scores of 70 or above for driver engagement.
...
In addition to the Mercedes GLE, the BMW 3-Series and the Audi Q8, received the highest rating of 'very good' while two models, the Renault Clio and the Peugeot received the lowest rating of 'entry'.|

9 days ago•Last reply 6 days ago| i sold all my tesla today because:

1. Iron phosphate based battery is much cheaper and safer for both cars and storage. Chinese BYD is selling well with its newly developed iron phosphate based battery.
most storage will use iron phosphate since its cheap and safe and weight does not mater to its applications.

2. KCAC is developing battery with VW thats is much better than what Tesla has announced on its battery day.

3. any significant price upward movement in LI, Co, Ni will have huge impact on its profit. Tesla has no long term control of those metal price.

4. there are many companies who are developing better batteries including LG Chem, Panosonic,
CATL, Tesla has little competitve advantages in battery technology compared to existing battery manufacturing.

5. SHLL has solution to use hybrid electricity and natural gas generator to solve air pollution for semi trucks and may be for smaller trucks too.

Next year Tesla rolls out another 1 mil robotaxi earning the same thing on top of the existing 1 mil robotaxi last year. That is 60 billion profit on 2nd year with only 2 million cars.

Samsung made the decision to wholesale copy the iPhone design when they realized it would take them a decade to catch up, and they paid in court for that theft, (2 billion I think), but that enabled them to catch iphone and trillions have been made by other smartphone manufacturers that also copied Apple and they paid nothing.

The Fed and other central banks print trillions in vapor dollars whenever they think they need to while commodities, fuel, food, and wages don't appreciate at the rate of "in favor" equities... so it seems like things are at a critical juncture of what the meaning of money actually is.|

In a sense Tesla is taking your bullish stock money to give back to society. While this is a great cause, I feel like most people in this chat misunderstand Tesla's mission.

7 days ago•Last reply 7 days ago| The Bureau of Labor Statistics has been tracking the Taxi industry for a long time. There are only about 75,000 active taxi drivers in the US, and less than 200,000 drivers in the ground transportation business. They make about $25,000 per year (median). Cab drivers probably don't cover their car costs.

Now Uber has about 900,000 drivers, they reportedly average $3.75/hour, so in a 2000 hour year, that's about $7,500 (let's call it $20,000 a year for the serious drivers). Uber drivers probably cover their car costs (above the $3.75/hour).

So we have about 1 million drivers, in total, in the entire USA.

1. How do bulls (and Tesla) think they are going to get 1 MM automated cars (in the near term at least?).
2. If the drivers are making $3.75 an hour, what do you think the profit is going to look like when 2 or 3,000 unmanned cars start driving around a major city? (The margins will drop like a rock).

Of course people may all of a sudden be really excited about getting into a car with no driver and paying MORE than when they have a driver, but that isn't likely to happen overnight, if at all. In all likelihood they will get in a car if they have to pay less.

Let's look at Uber for a moment. We know they have about 900,000 drivers in the US, and those drivers generated about $2.5 billion in sales in 2019. That's about $28,000 of revenue per driver.

With 1.1 million drivers (uber and taxi . . . didn't add in lyft here) @$30,000, if prices were to drop by 30% (no driver) and tesla were to take about 15% of that, then we have about $20 billion in driver revenue, and 3 billion in profit.

That's essentially the ENTIRE market and assumes no competition.

The ride hailing business may be a good business, but the profits are not likely to pan out so well given the competitive landscape. (Note that there are many active autonomous ride hailing services now, in limited areas).

Tesla's entries came in 2nd, with the Model 3 taking 10.6% and 13.7% for all models.

Polestar sold 8.7% this month while MG came in with 6.3%.

Again, sticking with the competition angle, note that there were 49 different models sold this month alone! There are a lot of other options out there, and the new ones are taking share from Tesla (VW ID.3 and Polestar namely).

2 years ago•Last reply 8 days ago| Those who are interested in Tesla's 2018Q3 results can be divided into three camps.

a) Short sellers and critics of Tesla
b) The Faithful of the Congregation of Tesla Shareholders
c) Those of weakening faith who still hold Tesla shares

Short sellers and critics can be ignored. They do not hold shares in Tesla nor are the Q3 results likely to prompt them to buy.

The Faithful hold it as an Article of Faith that Q3 will be profitable and cash flow positive. They are unlikely to buy more shares upon release of Q3 results. Their faith would have already prompted them to buy if they were inclined to do so. As a matter of faith, they are likely to continue to hold no matter how bad the results may be.

It is those whose faith is wavering who hold the fate of the Tesla share price in their hands. They are withholding their funds from buying pending confirmation of the predictions of profits and positive cash flow.

Whatever their privately held thoughts of profit and cash flow, reported results must exceed their expectations to prompt those of wavering faith to buy. Any shortfall from their expectations is likely to prompt them to sell.

Any bump in share price is likely to be temporary. Those of wavering faith will soon turn their thoughts to "What is the encore to continue to drive the share price higher?" Those whose faith is wavering, by nature, are cynics. Reasons to sell are easy to find. Reasons to sell need not even have anything to do with Tesla. There must always be new reasons just to continue to hold much less to buy.

In the absence of continual encouragement, those whose faith is wavering will continue to drive a declining price trend with their selling, punctuated by occasional dead cat bounces.|

8 days ago•Last reply 8 days ago| So... if Tesla says they manufactured 125K cars @ $1K loss each but obscures the fact that demand has completely dried up because they were unable to locate any quasi-governmental entities to backstop the manufacturing quotas and there aren't actual human beings that want the vehicles, how much will the stock price go up?|

8 days ago•Last reply 8 days ago| I thought I saw a news headline from an EV reporting source that Tesla has already released 3rd Q record breaking numbers. I did not get the entire article. If so, the price really has not moved much due to the news. The source was said to be some one close to the matter. ???|
8 days ago| Now we learn that it was in reference to Tesla achieving a record delivery volume during the week, according to sources familiar with the matter.

It came after Musk sent an email to employees during the previous week to inform them that record deliveries for the quarter were achievable, but they needed to deliver “the most number of vehicles per day that we would ever have to deliver.”

While the total number of deliveries during the quarter is still unknown, it looks like Tesla might have achieved Musk’s goal.

Wall Street has high expectations with a delivery estimate consensus of roughly 140,000 vehicles — rising from 123,000 just a few weeks ago.

Tesla is expected to release its Q3 delivery and production results by the end of the week.

Electrek’s Take
I am a bit confused about this quarter. Most delivery estimates are between 135,000 and 145,000 vehicles and they seem to be based on what Tesla needs to get to be on pace to achieve its targeted 500,000 deliveries for the full year.

However, Elon indicated that they have “a shot at record quarter for deliveries.”

Considering Tesla’s last record deliveries were 112,000 vehicles, it would put this quarter closer to that range.

However, as I mentioned in my previous article about the email, Elon always leaves room for interpretation in those emails to all employees.

He could have meant US or North American deliveries only as some have interpreted it, but the email was sent out to all employees globally, and in previous similar emails, he was referring to Tesla’s global deliveries.|

8 days ago•Last reply 8 days ago| In last night's debate, Biden exceeded the low bar set for him by Trump, Republicans, and even Democrats themselves. Many thought Biden would drop out of the debate but Biden actually survived it. The moderator, Chris Wallace, was universally described as awful.

So what did we "learn" in the debate?

We learned the self-described "empathetic," "caring" Biden arrogantly told President Trump to "shut up," savagely calling the President a "clown," "racist," and "liar." Democrats such as Biden (48-year career Washington DC insider politician) relentlessly throw personal insults at opponents, while simultaneously playing the victim. President Trump is a doer; Biden is just a talker who has done nothing in 48 years, except tell black people "you ain't black." Biden's always talking, talking, talking, .......

We also learned President Trump criticized Biden's policy proposals that will destroy the economy. President Trump asked Biden: Why aren't any police departments supporting you? Biden said some are. Trump responded: Name one ... we'll wait. Biden: (crickets). Trump asked Biden: Will you raise taxes? Biden: Dahng straight I will. Trump: Joe, will you say you're for Law & Order? Biden: (crickets). Trump: Ok, Biden's answer is No. Trump: Joe, do you support Bernie's New Green Deal? Biden: No. Trump: WOW, that's NEWS! The Bernie Bros will REALLY hate that, Joe! Biden: (crickets). Trump: Joe, everyone knows if you're elected President, the extreme, radical Bernie far-left will dominate your administration. Biden: No they won't. Trump: Oh sure, you signed a Unity Manifesto Agreement with the far-left Bernie/AOC and now you claim you'll stand up to the radical socialists Bernie & AOC? ... NOT! Biden: (crickets).

President Trump will strongly, proudly defend America. Biden (far-left Kamala/Bernie/Omar/Soros/AOC) will "dismantle" America (their actual words).

That's what we learned from last night's debate.|

8 days ago•Last reply 8 days ago| Generally options are a main driving force in the shareprice dynamic for TSLA. And the expiration as the expensive options unwind a particularly significant part of that dynamic. This week, despite the possibility that production/delivery number could be released friday morning, the day of expiration, the amount of open interest in TSLA options is much lower than typical with the dollar value of those options being resultingly low in value. This makes the LDV strike less likely than usual to be a dominant factor in the shareprice dynamic. The same is true for next week oct 9. So the production/delivery number could move the stock in a sustained manner if it is extreme from expectations. That being said, I still stand by the other overriding factor , that the recent high achieved a few weeks ago on the premarket session following the split of about $533 represents a durable top because it was a "historic" level of froth. So despite what the pumpers post, it is almost certain that it will not be eclipsed even by "great" numbers in the upcoming report. On the other hand, those that are extreme bashers should realize that the stock could rise a "lot" if the numbers are much better than expected.
Bottom line, the extremists will lose out and miss the mark................................|

Elon Musk’s enterprises are creating thousands of new good jobs. Both champion manufacturing products made by American companies. There is a mutual desire to reversing the balance of trade in favor of the US. Tesla’s 100% owned foreign gigafactories’s profits go back home. Both want a US Space Force and to go to the Moon and Mars through a partnership with NASA and the commercial sector. The have a goal of revitalizing the US infrastructure in an efficient and environmentally sound way. They are champions of US energy independence. Both
are proven free/private entrepreneurs that think out of the box. They are innovators and doers to a very high degree. Thought differing in some ways as to how/when all this is to be accomplished in the future they are both very pro American. They compliment each other’s efforts far more than they detract.|

"Consumer Reports included the 2019 Tesla Model X on its list of least reliable cars, deeming the electric vehicle “more showy than practical.” As Motor Biscuit pointed out, the Model X also came in dead last in 2018, with the worst reliability rating of any vehicle that year. While Kelley Blue Book didn’t give the Model X a full grade, it wouldn’t have been kind based on the publication’s comments about its price tag, recharging time and mobility.

The 2016 and 2017 versions of the Model X also made CR’s recommendations for used cars to avoid buying due to its “much-worse-than-average reliability.”|

One of the biggest things people don't mention/realize is that China sits on of the world's largest lithium supply (top 3 with Australia/Chile). Tesla, while a leader in the industry, has a disadvantage as they have to source from elsewhere, which inherently increases production cost. I own both $TSLA and $NIO.

BY Reuters
— 7:40 AM ET 09/30/2020
BEIJING, Sept 30 (Reuters) - U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc ( TSLA) is poised to start selling some Model 3 vehicles made in China equipped with cobalt-free lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, two people familiar with the matter said.

Currently the Model 3 electric sedans made at the carmaker's Chinese plant use nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) batteries. The starting price for the vehicles is currently 271,550 yuan ($39,900) after factoring in government subsidies.

Tesla will announce the product change as early as Thursday, the two sources said. They declined to be named as the matter is confidential.

Tesla was not immediately available for comment.

LFP batteries are cheaper to make and contain no cobalt, one of the most expensive metals used in electric vehicle batteries. Tesla will use LFP batteries in all Model 3 vehicles made in China with standard driving ranges, according to the sources.

In China, the world's biggest car market, Tesla sold over 11,000 vehicles, mostly Model 3s, in August. It is also building a new car manufacturing capacity for Model Y sport-utility vehicles in Shanghai and expects to start delivery of them from next year.|

There are no rampant forest fires there (and strangely enough on the US's east coast),.... the key is proper forestry management". Theseforestsfires are natural phenomena that have been happening since the invention of fire.

What hasn't happened is people crowding into them and then the local wackogovernemntoutlawing proper forestry management that would otherwise keep the forests clean ofdead trees (aka fuel) forforestfires to feed on.

Infactfarleftwackos are actually starting the fires to claimcluelessChris'ignorance is correct.

Whatever happened to those comercials 30 years ago where smokey the bear said "only you can prevent forestfires"?

Today the data looks like:
VW ID.3 has 133 of 499 EVs for 26.6% share (All VW models caught 190 or 38%)
Tesla (all models) sold 91 for 18% (surge in Model S deliveries)
MG in third with 36 for 7%
Audi in fourth with 35 for 7% (also included in the 38% number)
Model S in 5th (counted above)
Polestar with 26 for 5.2%

Notable was Hyundai/Kia with 27 total

For the month we have . . .
VW ID.3 - 1811 or 18.5% (All VW models caught 32.7% share)
Tesla Model 3 - 1079 or 11% share (All Tesla caught 14% share)
Polestar - 868 or 8.9% share

There were 48 different models sold in Norway so far this month.

9 days ago| Walmart Canada is now reserving a total of 130 Tesla Semi trucks, making it one of the largest reservations of electrified trucks in the country. The move comes on the heels of Walmart Canada announcing a major $3.5 billion investment over the next five years aimed to generate significant growth in the business and is aligned with Walmarts global goal to target zero emissions by 2040 announced at Climate Week earlier this month

The $3.5 billion investment will impact every aspect of the business leading to a faster e-commerce experience, two new distribution centres to speed up the flow of products, re-invented and "smarter" stores, an enhanced omni experience and modern digital tools to ensure associates can best serve customers.
Walmart Canada has built a best-in-class supply chain and is continuing to put sustainability at the forefront of its business operations, finding new and innovative ways to reduce its carbon footprint while continuing to focus on safety and delivering value to its customers. Walmart Canada is committed to converting 20 per cent of Walmart's fleet to electric power by the end of 2022, as part of the goal of its broader goal to power its fleet using 100 per cent alternative power by 2028.|

I'm guessing that they won't roll over and die. It's also worth noting that Daimler is already using Solid State batteries . . . in buses for now. I'm guessing they are learning pretty fast too.

9 days ago| NOT GOOD FOR TSLA !! BDO said retailers closed 7,282 stores in the first half, which is already beyond the just under 6,000 in all of 2018. A lackluster 2018 holiday season is partly to blame.

"The 2018 holiday season failed to meet expectations, with December retail sales dropping 1.6% from the month prior -- the weakest sales performance since December 2009," the report states.

Ten retailers filed for bankruptcy in the first quarter of 2019, BDO says, including Payless, Gymboree and Charlotte Russe, which together led to the closure of roughly 3,700 stores. Retailers that filed in July and August include Charming Charlie, Barney's, A'gaci and Avenue Stores.

Challenges for retailers so far this year include the government shutdown in January, bad weather across the country and higher cost of goods due to trade tariffs — all of which had consumers closing their wallets.|

There were EVs before Tesla. But no one wanted to drive them. Elon Musk changed that. In the same way, there was ride-hailing before Facedrive. But it had no “impact investing” appeal. Facedrive is changing that.|

A new investigation by BuzzFeed and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists found banks’ internal compliance officers flagged a total of more than $2 trillion in transactions between 1999 and 2017 as possible money laundering or other criminal activity.
The report cited confidential documents submitted by banks to the U.S. government.
These leaked suspicious activity reports do not necessarily indicate wrongdoing, and they were just a tiny fraction of the reports filed with U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the news report said.|

I did my DD and im heavily rewarded.
Now i did my DD on NIO and even if its a chinese stock...

It is EXACTLY like tesla before the big jump up.
People really dont see the upward potential in NIO, its not because you dont see a NIO car on the road in america or europe that it isnt growing F A S T. im lucky enough to be able to travel here and there, and in china it is a starting to become a really popular brand among SUV drivers|

9 days ago| I love articles like Cleantechnica's recent article about Tesla's contribution to saving the world.

There is no doubt that EVs are helping to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and that is a good thing, but let's be clear. EVs have had almost zero effect on oil consumption. (It may be possible to argue that it is helping to reduce the GROWTH in fossil fuel consumption).

Here is the annual consumption figures, direct from the EIA statistics database. The 2020 and 2021 data are estimates and obviously heavily impacted by COVID-19.

Motor Gasoline (million barrels/day)
2016 - 9.32
2017 - 9.33
2018 - 9.33 <---- This is when the Tesla Model 3 was introduced
2019 - 9.31
2020 - 8.27 <--- That's an 11.2% drop expected for the year
2021 - 9.08 <--- That's down 2.5% from 2019, and likely due to unemployment, not EVs

To date, there is almost ZERO effect on fuel usage, and that doesn't include Diesel, Jet Fuel, etc.

EVs are wonderful, but they haven't impacted gas usage in any meaningful way yet and likely won't for another decade. The biggest contributor (as you can clearly see) is a partial ban on travel, and that only takes about about 15% of fuel consumption (and that includes Jet Fuel).

What happened this week was brilliant, all the weak hands sold their stocks due to fear, new investors came in with a better price, and now strong hands are holding Tesla.

Entering 2020, the Democrat Party knew the 28 Democrat Presidential Primary candidates not named Biden (e.g., Bill DeBlasio, Kamala Harris, Beto O'Rourke) had zero chance of defeating President Trump. So a Democrat political strategist concocted the Democrats' insane Long-Shot Strategy to defeat President Trump ... and the desperate Democrats instantly put that strategy into motion:

The George Soros-financed Democrats knew the Communist China Party (CCP) Wuhan virus (Wu-Flu) was spreading throughout the world. So the Democrat Party decided: Let's disgracefully take advantage of and misuse the CCP Wu-Flu Global Pandemic against the U.S. & President Trump because it's our only chance for election victory. We'll wait for the perfect opportunity (during the Global Pandemic) to perpetrate mass chaos & destruction throughout the U.S. As you've seen, Democrats are using their typical Election-Year tactic of falsely accusing everyone else of being a "racist," falsely claiming there's "rampant systemic racism" throughout the U.S. Hypocritical Democrats/Black Lives Matter are basically saying, Ignore the 7,000 black people killed annually by other black people (mostly by young black men); instead, we hypocritical Democrats cherry-picked one case, that of the violent career criminal George Philbin, to perpetrate ongoing, nationwide violent riots & chaos throughout the U.S. The desperate Democrats (and their many far-left allies) instantly went into Hyper-Drive, constantly screaming about "Black Lives Matter," that there's suddenly "rampant systemic racism" throughout the U.S., and describing the violent fiery riots as "peaceful protests." The Marxist violent BLM/Antifa organization has been perpetrating its ongoing mob riots in 55+ major Democrat-run cities throughout the U.S. for 125 straight days (with no end in sight) during this Election Year. The Marxist AOC posted an Instagram video in which she says Trump's nomination of a woman to the Supreme Court must wildly "Radicalize" all Democrats. Also, Democrats are perpetrating a totally unprecedented, nationwide, ginormous (and easily corruptible) mail-in balloting campaign. The Democrat mail-in ballot scheme guarantees that Nov. 3 cannot possibly result in a definitive Presidential election outcome on that day. Instead, Democrats have planned to spend many more months (maybe a year) after the election so desperate Democrats can continue endlessly "counting all ballots," endlessly filing lawsuits against the U.S., many states, and local jurisdictions, etc. The main purpose of all this? To satisfy George Soros's Master Scheme of totally destabilizing the U.S. political system. Soros & the far-left Democrat Party desperately seek to entirely "dismantle the whole system" of the U.S. (actual quote from U.S. Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar).

But all of that is not enough for desperate Democrats. Kamala Harris and Sleepy Joe Biden, in their speeches last week, both repeatedly talked up the "Harris Administration." Kamala Harris said her "Harris Administration" will be very progressive while Joe Biden talked up the "Harris/Biden Administration." Mere coincidence? Nope. That's the Harris/Biden signal to the Bernie Bro's that once Biden is elected President, Sleepy Joe will quickly resign so U.S. President Kamala Harris can quickly take over and enact Marxist Bernie Sanders' far-left agenda to "dismantle" the U.S. That fits in perfectly with George Soros's Master Scheme to subjugate the U.S. under Soros's planned borderless, global open-society central government. BTW, Kamala's voting record proves she's the most far-left Senator (even farther left than Bernie), based on the non-partisan organization GovTrack's research report. That report forced the far-left CNN to publicly admit Kamala's "voting record in the Senate certainly is one of the most liberal." Actually, it's THE most liberal. Kamala has repeatedly voted against many of Trump's federal judge nominees and Trump's selections for top positions in his own administration. Nevertheless, Biden's BLM/Antifa-controlled Democrat handlers still continue their Biden-in-a-Basement "campaign." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi continues demanding that Biden refuse to participate in Presidential Debates and stay in his basement.

Yet even that is not enough for desperate Democrats. The angry, far-left CNN political analyst, Gloria Borger, yesterday talked up Democrat Senators boycotting their required meetings with Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett and even boycotting the Senate hearings for Ms. Coney Barrett. Even worse, a growing number of mainstream Democrats are now screaming that Democrats must "burn down" everything because President Trump nominated a woman to the U.S. Supreme Court.

That is the current state of today's Democrat Party.|

13 days ago•Last reply 9 days ago| TSLA options/option expiration always play a significant part in the share price dynamic. Sometimes huge, ie the biggest factor on a short term basis, ie , days, hours , minutes as it approaches expiration. Last week was an example, where the whole week it played a role in boosting the shares. This week the expiration is for TSLA a relatively low open interest/ low dollar value, with the LDV strike at $400, however the dollar value for strikes $380-415 are essentially the same, and even further away from that ie $360- 425 are higher but not to the amount that we usually see. So what does it mean? That the trading today will not be dominated by the option expiration LDV to a great extent. Now it is possible for that to change to a small degree late in the day if there is a build up in open interest earlier , depending on the state of the unwind, but even then more than likely this will be a day that TSLA will trade mainly on other factors surrounding investor/traders positioning for today and next week etc.|

And some are upset that Tesla has and is getting too much taxpayer incentives? Therefore, Tesla has to raise its own capital (profits, borrowed or stock sale) and go it alone in competing with the government supported Chinese electric car manufacturers. Xpeng is receiving free government grants. Then China will start dumping EVs in America cutting prices below their cost to drive Tesla out of business. China has done this before with steel, heavy equipment, car manufacturing, shipping, aircraft and many other US job killing unfair trade practices. To level the playing field either heavily tariff their imports or give Tesla half a billion to compete.|

So much can be learned from an hour DD. I have read a comparison of “like intel is to computers”. Also Zero motorcycles said it was like a supercharger for their High Permanence.

First of many to come, recent analysts rated the stock under valued. Buy rating. Look at current partners.

The real run is coming. Big multiplier when you buy in at 1.33cdn.

This is not advice, but rather a gift to those who take the time.

IMHO, this will become a CORE holding for many, Ai algorithm, covered by patients and did I mention licensing revenue stream? Boom !

If you have a look and like what you see, see you on the Bulls Boards.

Once again this is not pumping, its sharing, something to little people do now a days. I hope you some pay it forward, should EXRO work extremely well for you based on your entry point.

2 years ago•Last reply 10 days ago| Consumer Reports can no longer recommend the newest Tesla—the Model 3 electric sedan—because members say they’ve identified a number of problems with their cars, including issues with its body hardware, as well as paint and trim. CR members reported these results in our annual reliability survey, which includes data on about 470,000 vehicles.

The Model 3 is a critical car for Tesla. It’s the automaker’s first attempt at a true mass-market electric vehicle (EV), and its long, bumpy launch into the consumer market starting in late 2017 was greeted by EV enthusiasts with a mixture of anticipation and frustration. The Model 3 rollout was plagued by numerous production delays and extraordinarily long wait times for customers who put down orders more than a year before delivery. Yet the small sports sedan has been received well by its owners, getting top marks in CR’s most recent owner satisfaction survey. It has also largely lived up to its promise as a highly competitive sports sedan, earning a respectable road-test score, which puts it not far behind the Audi A4 and BMW 3 Series.

But reliability has been a weak spot for Tesla. According to our survey results, problems with the suspension, especially with the 2017 model year, have been an issue for the Model S luxury sedan, while hardware problems—especially concerning its unique falcon-wing doors—have plagued the Model X SUV (neither is currently recommended by CR). And now our latest survey data has surfaced numerous problems reported by Model 3 owners as well, which is why CR has removed its recommendation for the vehicle.

“While Teslas perform well in Consumer Reports’ road tests and have excellent owner satisfaction, their reliability has not been consistent, according to our members, which has resulted in changes to their recommended status,” says Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing at Consumer Reports.

Tesla currently holds the top spot on our list of brands that satisfy owners the most, based on their new vehicle lineup.

“In most cases, reliability issues will undermine satisfaction,” Fisher adds. “But when a vehicle has an enthusiastic following, like with Tesla, owners may overlook some issues. We’ve seen this with other vehicles such as the Jeep Wrangler and Chevrolet Corvette.”|

The expectation is that the consumers can only buy cars with 4680 battery in 2022, maybe in 2021. It is put in production Tesla vehicles but not for sale to the public. I guess Tesla employees can buy them for alpha testing. Some articles from analysts emphasis 4680 battery are put in production vehicles are misleading. In short, Battery Day is not a success. There must be some flaw Elon Musk found in the lab, so Battery Day is unofficially delayed to 2022.|

10 days ago•Last reply 10 days ago| George Soros said: "The main obstacle to a stable and just world order is the United States."

George Soros said: "The main enemy of the open society, I believe, is no longer the communist but the capitalist threat."

George Soros said: "... the United States constitutes a serious threat to the peace and prosperity of the world."

In addition, George Soros frequently says he's on a mission to create one borderless, global "open society."

So, based solely on the stated beliefs and actual words of the radical, anti-U.S. zealot George Soros, these are the indisputable facts: George Soros believes the U.S. is a despicable, unjust country; George Soros believes American "capitalism" is his "main enemy"; George Soros thinks American "capitalism" is far worse than "communism"; and George Soros believes "the United States" is an extremely deadly "serious threat to the peace and prosperity of the world."

Those are the reasons that the extreme, anti-U.S. zealot George Soros gives for his maniacal mission (in conjunction with the far-left Democrat Party and all its allies) to totally destabilize and dismantle the United States of America ....... during this Election Year. And that's why George Soros is spending virtually all of his many tens of billions of dollars of wealth (that he earned in the U.S.) on doing exactly that.

Here is something that the vile, anti-U.S. zealot George Soros definitely does not want you to know -- George Soros's entire borderless global open-society Master Scheme totally hinges upon George Soros defeating President Trump in this election.

So wouldn't it be great for all American citizens to join together as one, re-elect President Trump, and totally stick it to that totally ungrateful, anti-U.S. zealot George Soros?

You bet your sweet aarhse it would.

P.S. George Soros's native Hungary and England have BOTH accused George Soros of intentionally undermining and deliberately destabilizing their respective countries. Do you see any pattern there?|

10 days ago•Last reply 10 days ago| As reality comes into sharper focus, it’s increasingly clear that myriads of newly minted EVs will be competing for market share across the transportation sector.

Five years is a long time, TSLA’s present market capitalization is based on the assumption that in FIVE YEARS all the following investment sectors will be dominated by TSLA.
1) auto manufacturing
2) energy production
3) energy storage
4) solar roof manufacturing
5) solar roof installation
6) rare earth mining
7) battery manufacturing
8) tunnel construction
9) space travel
10. Mars colonization

Simple domination in these investment sectors isn’t sufficient to account for TSLAs stratospheric market capitalization......TSLA must destroy all competition, to justify TSLAs valuation,
traditional valuation metrics must be entirely rewritten.

How many reasonable people will continue to fund this non-sustainable juggernaut.|

10 days ago| Sodium-ion batteries are better for static energy storage . . . But Tesla didn't tell you that . . . they may not even know.

"There’s also a cost advantage from using more plentiful, and cheaper, raw materials. Natron sells battery systems to data center customers at a similar price to both existing lead-acid packs and lithium-ion products, but it says its technology winds up being three times cheaper over the long term because of the life span of the battery."

But you can believe that Tesla is going to have 300GWh of a 155GWh industry where the competitors are vast, strong and have a whole range of solutions (note the Fuel Cell is also expected to be less expensive than Li-ON batteries)|

10 days ago•Last reply 10 days ago| 👀 READ TSLA After the pandemic, we have seen a surge of Zombie Companies. These are a category of companies that just like a virus, are sucking up the lifeblood out of government aid and cheap credit, thanks to the central banks. These are called Zombie Companies. They are Companies that are refusing to close their doors despite being unable to pay off their debts, instead of feeding off government aid or cheap credit from central banks. Zombie corporations are those who cannot cover their debt servicing costs from current profits over an extended period of time. Basically, companies that never made a profit never will make a profit and need Fed's cheap and easy money to survive. Every company that has to do with fracking, Tesla, WeWork, a few dozen tech unicorns in the IPO line, and probably a whole bunch of office REITs, hotels, and airlines for starters. If a company has had at least the past three years, during which the profits it earned were not enough to pay off its debts, we call it (that is the financial press calls it) a zombie company.|

11 days ago•Last reply 10 days ago| Tesla's market share for all EVs

- Europe - 9% (LOTS of new competition still to come, and EU is now the largest EV market in the world)
- China - 12.9% (competition has been entrenched for a while, but still new players coming. 2nd largest mkt)
- US - 48.6% (Almost no competition; market is 1/3 the size of Europe currently)

Overall, Tesla currently has 15.8% market share for these major markets. But the ramp of competition is really just starting. VW alone will sell 100,000 or more EVs in the second half of this year. And they are just starting with the delivery of ID.3. ID.4 deliveries will start around the world in November/December so it could be more.

This all bodes well for saving the planet . . .

Don't be delusional about Tesla market share. When there is competition, Tesla's position is whittled away in all price ranges.

That is pretty stupid view to take as it is pretty easy to setup the brains capturing the driving behaviour for Chinese customers within China and even hand it over to the Chinese Communist party if they want it. Tesla does not need to have access to that data in the US. They just need the data that is ring fenced to operate their Chinese business. Any perceived problem with that can be easily resolved.

Do you realize that it created a process with casting that a part of one of its cars I think the back end can be assembled in one piece. Do you understand how huge this is. This company cannot be valued accurately because no company has every created manufacturing processes and technologies in any industry prior. We are witnessing technology created at warp speed that every other company will want to emulate.

But why people ignoring reason tesla getting into bettery manufacturing and weather they account for everything or rushing?

First why they entering:- What they reveal in battery day was shock. They not able to improve battery cost at all for last few years. Big Big deal specially when material cost is significant down over years.

Their promise to decrease cost is based on various planning and we all know nothing ever go as per plan. In case of Elon more it planned, more it go other way. He will sleep there to fix problem created by rushing and sometime able to turn around, other time end up worst way ( Example is FSD which is now 3rd rewrite iteration and he is again excited and want to rush to market. He didn't learn from earlier rewrite & expensive hardware replacement because he sell with fully function FSD car on hardware wise..)|
10 days ago| It's not quite end of day in Norway, but close . . . here is the latest daily results:

VW ID.3 - 199 vehicles or 26% of today's deliveries
Tesla Model 3 - 83 vehicles or 18% of today's deliveries
Others (26 other models were sold) - 257 vehicles or 56%

For the month,
VW ID.3 has taken 18% share - All VW vehicles have about 32%
Tesla (all models) have taken 13.7% share
Polestar has taken 9.1% share and
MG has taken 6.1% share.

The remaining 39% or so goes to the other 37 models

So there does appear to be competition in Europe . . .

10 days ago| Tesla: Pay No Taxes, Take More Handouts
For at least a year now we have heard complaints from GM and Tesla about the need to extend the electric vehicle (EV) tax credit, with just these two companies upset that their gravy train is coming to an end. These companies insist that it is crucial that the EV tax credit be expanded and extended, and have convinced a few members of Congress to introduce a bill to do just that. One could pass it off as just your standard rent-seeking of the sort that goes on every day in Washington, but a funny thing about these two rent-seekers: they don’t pay taxes. That’s right, the two companies demanding more taxpayer subsidies don’t even pay corporate income taxes.

The EV tax credit is manufacturer specific and begins to phase out once a company has sold 200,000 eligible vehicles. GM and Tesla hit both that threshold last year, the only companies that have done so. Taxpayers are still on the hook for the full EV tax credit for every other car company, adding up to billions of dollars, and even GM and Tesla buyers will continue to be eligible for reduced credits for a while. Billions already out the door, with billions more committed, but still not enough for GM and Tesla. In a shameless display, these two companies—who pay no corporate tax—insist that they should get even more in subsidies from the rest of us.|

10 days ago•Last reply 10 days ago| People now start inflating on Battery claim and I love it. Look like I might start buying put soon.

Here is reason I think people should worried what they paying and book profit or avoid big losses risk. There are many other reason biggest demand but I will focus on battery day for now.

1.> Battery day, while people don't like it's 3 full Elon Year away ( Elon Year factor normally is 1.5x-5x and I think this likely near 3x+ at least given complete restructure and based on Event it look like it's just in 1 year which mean they yet to do proper validation of technology.).
2.> Even bigger thing people ignored, how analyst wrong when they thought Tesla already closer to $100 kwh cost with cost advantage, what they revealed is last few years cost hardly improved even with lower material cost. It's reason Tesla take such risky route.
3.> Also all factory efficiency claim likely turn out bogus, more dense factory may be cheaper but much harder to keep running as repair can get tricky and required shutting non impacted unit as well. Also everything have tight dependancy on other unit efficiency.
3.> Tabless design look good and logical but there is also big risk. Reason it was not used before - gain is not significant for electronics but fire risk is very increase significantly. . If there is leak, It will explode. Sure with technology you can make it very less chance but you need 1 bad apple. Sure They can improve by 5-10% efficiency but does it worth risk.
3.> Bigger cell design again made possible with tabless design which reduce heating due to shorter more paradelle possitive/negative nodes. But remember if just one of those bad, you now have 1 cell = 5-6 previous cell worth fire power. Again fire risk multiply by factor of 5-6.
4.> Silicone solution is worst in my opinion. Probably not properly test with extreme conditions. This is where most delay in my opinion ( Along with tab-less connections quality control issue)
5.> Remember Tesla choose most volatile chemistry of li-ion battery basically insake of density it take risky battery. With bigger and bigger cell, less and less separation between two nodes, it becoming risky. It sound like Elon trying to test extreme limit of this volatile chemistry. Not saying Elon dump and ignoring but he is risk taker.
5.> There are 10 different solid state battery technology evolving around world which much much supperior.
On other end Elon think it's next to impossible to produce solid state battery in economically viable way.

Overall While if Elon success in 4-5 year can bring Tesla some edge, It's not as much (Other are going to improving same time. Infact they are in pressure to respond and They working hard already.)
If Solid state battery are mass produced even might expensive, it's game over for Tesla billions of investment as next to worthless.|

10 days ago•Last reply 10 days ago| So let's work on more math . . . LG Chem produces about 50GWh of battery capacity at the end of 2019 and is expecting production to increase to about 100GWh by end of 2020 (working on a plant with GM for 50GWh of capacity.)

They are expected to be valued at $24 billion in 2024 (that's from Cleantechnica), and by that time they are expected to have over 200GWh of production capacity.

So 200GWh of production capacity (or more) should be valued at $24 billion. Hmmm. Does that mean that Tesla's 10GWh production plans or even 100GWh production plans are seriously over valued? Perhaps, but I'm just being a rational human being.

10 days ago| With the efficiency being introduced on each giga factory and the improvement in productivity the end result might be that the current estimate for how many giga factory produced to deliver x number of vehicles will need to be revised. I think we are looking at half the estimated giga factory to produce the same number of vehicles. In other words if the current estimate is 20 factories then accounting for the efficiency we are seeing we might be looking at 10 factories which will result in half the time in years to get there. This is exponential growth people!|

10 days ago| "The current slump in EV sales does not necessarily indicate a change in trend. "

As whackey as this is - it's actually accurate because there is no trend. EVs are not popular. Even with huge government incentives they do not sell well.

Tesla is, to a degree, the exception to the rule. They are willing to incur unsustainable losses and service a mountain of debt to sell a few hundred thousands EVs per year.

BTW the institutions are not willing to participate in another IPO so Tesla will be selling shares ( $5 billion) on the open market.|

Dorx don't see that when he/she musters to pass final exams, goes to work and start to earn money he/she will pay taxes to support *free education* for other future Dorx. Instead of paying for his own education Dorx is paying for other Dorx education.

Market is highly volatile this week. Tuesday, Presidential debate; Wednesday, GDP Q2 third revision and end of month; Thursday, initial jobless claims. Fyi.

HERE IS AN OBSERVATION:

The Presidential Debate is going to be a "good thing". And, that is because DJT will make himself look foolish - because almost everything he will say will be "fact checked" by informed people
who are not anyone's "fools".

Subsequently, the debate will make Biden look better and significantly increase not only his likelihood of winning the Presidency - but more importantly, will increase the superior probability of a Democratic majority in the Senate and the House - and ultimately a "take over"
of Congress.

It is looking "really good". :)|

11 days ago| Someone should have told Trump to buy some Tesla stock.

From NYT 2020-08-27:
"Danger Signs Ahead: The president’s tax returns suggest that as he approaches one of the most consequential elections in American history — down in most polls, under I.R.S. audit and heavily in debt — his businesses may not be well equipped to navigate what lies ahead.

As many of his companies continue to lose money, Mr. Trump has more than $300 million in loans, for which he is personally responsible, coming due within the next four years. He liquidated hundreds of millions of dollars in stocks in recent years and may have less than $1 million left in his portfolio, according to his public financial disclosures. The pandemic has crippled the hospitality and recreation industry that so much of his portfolio of properties is dependent on.

And hanging over his head is the audit. Should the I.R.S. reverse the huge refund he received 10 years ago, Mr. Trump could be on the hook for more than $100 million."|

NO,The reason was and still is is that he's obviously humiliated, which his body language and facial expression show, because of the millions, and millions of dollars is more lost in the last five years alone, which is why he hated and resented it coming out publicly.

THIS, is obviously, and evidently why,
he vigorously tried to protect, and went to the Supreme Court, which no one ever did, because of his unprecedented, potential ability to be humiliated, which he just was tonight.

THIS, it will not reflect very positively, because he just gave away a lot of leverage to Biden,

I told her whether she wanted to buy $NKLA, $TSLA, $SHLL, or $IDEX instead, and she said these other stocks can drop a lot at any time and might never go back up. She said she feels NIO has much more chance of increasing value and much little chance of dropping, especially for the long term. For me, I feel NIO can give a 5x to 10x return in less than 5 years. China is a growth market with over 1 billion people, and so even in this pandemic, NIO's sales should not be affected. The old days when China was merely manufacturing and not innovating are over (have you seen those really creative products advertised on TikTok? They're invented in China!), and NIO will soon capture consumers in Europe and the US. For now, NIO is undervalued because many Americans, young and old, are still resistant to investing in a Chinese company, although they're loving their dropshipping companies, Aliexpress, TikTok, and if they ever had the chance to visit China, the public transport, EV buses, and malls that make US cities look outdated. Eventually, investors will have to abandon their old thinking and follow the blue sky of the future, quality products, and money!|

Anyone could easily search google to fill in the gaps if a few of his terms were unfamiliar. I think the stock is going down because too many people do not understand how engineering works and how long it takes. It takes longer to refine a new technology than it takes to build the factory to produce it. But most people think it is much easier. So when Elon said it would take up to 3 years to get the new larger dry electrode battery to achieve acceptable yield it was longer than people were expecting. That is what happens when non engineers speculate about the engineering development process. At least it is faster than curing cancer. Also saying that Tesla would be constrained by the rate at which its battery suppliers could make batteries has some thinking that the 50% growth expectation isn't valid after 2019. In my opinion this correction is healthy.|

11 days ago| So if Tesla produces 20GWh at $100/KWh in 2023, that's $20 billion in revenue.

CATL is the most expensive battery company out there right now . . . their P/S is about 9x. So if these valuations hold, that would make Tesla's battery business worth $180B in 2023.

If their car business trades at 3x book value (which is 3x higher than other car manufacturers), and assuming they get to $20 billion in book value by 2023, then the car business would be worth $60B in 2023.

Tesla should be worth about 240 billion in 2023. If these insane valuations hold, then the company should drop by at least half in the next two to three years.

Of course, that's assuming all the dreams and promises come to fruition.
(P.S. - Did anyone notice that FSD is level 2 autonomy now? That's what the Tesla press kit says).

Polluting rivers and killing wildlife
There have been huge problems reported from the surrounding areas of the Ganzizhou Rongda lithium mine in Tibet.

Protestors from the nearby town of Tagong took to the streets in 2016, after fish from the nearby Liqi River were found dead on mass following a toxic chemical leak from the mine.

The area has seen a sharp rise in mining activity in recent years, which has led to two similar incidents in just a seven-year period. Fish and other livestock have been found dead after drinking the polluted water.

Chinese automotive firm BYD (Build Your Dreams), which is the world’s largest supplier of lithium-ion batteries for smartphones and other forms of technology, is one of the companies which undertakes mining operations in the area.



Environmental problems in South America
Lithium-ion battery environmental impact
In Salar de Atacama, mining activities consumed up to 65% of the region’s water, causing havoc for local farmers (credit: Francesco Mocellin)
In Chile, the world’s second-biggest lithium producer after Australia, is also feeling the effects of mining.

In order to begin operations, miners drill holes into salt flats to pump salty, mineral-rich brine to the surface.

The holes are then left for a period of up to 18 months so the liquid can evaporate, before returning to scoop up the lithium carbonate, which can then be turned into metallic lithium.

But this leaves the potential situation similar to the one in Tibet, destroying local habitats and polluting nearby grasslands and rivers, with hydrochloric acid being used in the lithium process.

One of the main issues in Chile, though, is the water consumption associated with lithium mining. For every tonne of lithium produced, 500,000 gallons of water is used.

In Salar de Atacama, mining activities consumed up to 65% of the region’s water, causing havoc for local farmers.

Elsewhere in South America, Argentinians in the Salar de Hombre Muerto natural salt pan have expressed concerns over the lithium mining in the region, citing contamination to streams and the irrigation of crops.

There have been reports that lithium operations are also damaging soil which farmers use to herd livestock in the region.

A report on lithium by the Friends of the Earth Europe charity said: “The extraction of lithium has significant environmental and social impacts, especially due to water pollution and depletion.

“In addition, toxic chemicals are needed to process lithium.

“The release of such chemicals through leaching, spills or air emissions can harm communities, ecosystems and food production.

“Moreover, lithium extraction inevitably harms the soil and also causes air contamination.”



Recycling issues
After receiving the Nobel Prize award, Akira Yoshino admitted that the key for the future of electric mobility is figuring out how to fully recycle batteries, saying the industry is not there yet.

The Japanese chemist also revealed that recycling batteries is the key to securing enough raw materials to power the surge in electric vehicle demand.

Speaking to Bloomberg, Yoshino said: “The point is whether electric vehicle batteries can be recycled. The cost should pay off if all waste car batteries in Japan are collected and processed.”

As part of the UK government’s £246m ($312m) Faraday Challenge for battery research, the University of Birmingham is trying to find new ways of recycling lithium-ion.

Research in Australia found that just 2% of the country’s 3,300 tonnes of lithium-ion waste is recycled.

This also leads to the potential scenario of fluids from the batteries leaking into landfills and releasing them into the environment.

Dr Gavin Harper, of the Faraday Institution’s lithium recycling project, told Wired: “Manufacturers are understandably secretive about what actually goes into their batteries, which makes it harder to recycle them properly.”

The most common procedure for recycling recovered lithium cells from devices and electric vehicles is to shred the cells, which creates a mixture of metal that can then be separated using burning techniques.

But a lot of the lithium is wasted using this method.



Ethical issues with lithium-ion batteries
DR Congo and cobalt

Critical to the construction of batteries, the silver-tinged metal cobalt has caught the world’s attention and emerged as central to some of the industries set to determine the future.

Cobalt is an essential element within lithium battery cells, alongside lithium, nickel and manganese, making up the metal oxide slurry of the battery cell’s cathode from which electricity is generated.

Trump University students were tricked into paying a lot of money for no real training, and then coerced into writing positive reviews. This is the scenario Trump wants to avoid after office for all his other crimes. Trump Foundation is already dissolved from fraud. Trump Organization (his hundreds of fake businesses and money laundering operations?). He claims the office of the U.S. Presidency gives him 100% immunity from all crimes, which is why he's been committing and suggesting others commit all sorts of crimes while in office. This is the reason he's using fear mongering tactics (like all dictators in history) and manipulating the very core of the American democratic way (voting) in order to stay in power, simply to avoid jail time.

The truth for Trump (as psychologists have pointed out about Trump due to having traits from all three dark triad traits, below) is whatever he believes at the time his mouth is opening, so there is no absolute truth in Trump's mind. This is why he lies 24/7 depending on who the audience is. This is also why he has no empathy. He's NOT CAPABLE of that human part of us. That's why he doesn't care about the sufferings of other people, including the almost quarter million dead Americans from his massive intentionally mishandling of the coronavirus. That's mass murder. His ex wife, Ivana, said Trump kept a book of Hitler's speeches by his bed and read it from time to time. Hitler liked to boast about his failures (North Africa and Russian fronts) as successes. Trump boasts about his failures as successes after his idol.

One technology that sounds promising is affordable flow batteries that permit the storage of 'charged' fluid separately in tanks. It would not totally supplant arrays of mass-produced cells.

The economy and the Stock market prospered to its HISTORIC HEIGHT until the China-virus hit! Even so, Trump’s effect and wise actions brought a quick recovery for both the economy and stock market, which propelled TSLA to its new height!
In short, just as Elon Musk is Red-pilled; so am I! It’s a no brained for the upcoming election: either you pick our great DEMOCRACY or COMMUNIST/SOCIALIST/TOTALITARIAN ( I.e. Dems) government! Once that kind of government sets in, our Great country is doomed! Example of Commies countries: N Korea, Venezuela, Belarus right now do not even allow true free elections as they killed/incarcerated/disqualified all serious competitors to the Commie regimes! Also, these countries will take from you anything they want... they called it “ nationalize”! For instance, Venezuela took Chevron’s oil field and company in their country! Result? In spite of having the largest oil field in the world, they ran it to the ground and now became one of the poorest countries in the world!
The Tesla stocks or any wealth you have can be “nationalized “ anytime under Biden-Kamala!
In short, the election is a no brained!|

Model 3, 13150 vs july 13450, -300
2nd Place is Toyota Prius 2500 vs 2950, -450
3rd Place Model X , 1825 vs July 1225, + 600
4th Place Model S, 1050 vs July 955, + 75

As can be seen, although Model 3 sold 300 less than July, but Better than Prius. And the 600 + and 75+ = 675 more than July gave Tesla a net gain of 375 cars in the expensive models, so the revenue will be higher than it is model 3. Boy It shows China has more rich people. No wonder they said China last year for the first time surpassed the US in terms of consumption. Folks you have to know China is a market 50% larger than US and entire Europe combined. When it’s consumption surpass the US it it only the beginning. Tesla can have so so sales in other markets but China alone can make a lot of money in years to come. I strongly recommend Tesla use the $5 billion to do another giga factory in Chengdu. It is so obvious.|

I believe the world will be buying 5MM EVs a year (at least) by 2025 and that tesla will sell about 1.3-1.5MM of those.

At 40k per car, you have 60 Billion in auto revenue and add in 20B in grid storage with a lofty 5% margin and you have 4 billion in profit. With a p/e of 40, that’s worth $160 billion.

If I’m off by a factor of 2, (100%) then it’s worth $320 billion .... in 2025.

13 days ago•Last reply 12 days ago| As reality sets in, it’s increasingly clear that a myriad of new EVs will dramatically increase market share across the transportation sector. Nearly all vehicle manufacturers have EVs in production, or nearing the production stage.

Nevertheless, TSLA/Musk fanboys insist that none of these new EVs hitting the market can hold a candle to the incredible TSLA. Notwithstanding this unprecedented positive investor sentiment, TRADITIONAL VALUATION METRICS TELL AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT STORY ABOUT TSLA’S STRATOSPHERIC MARKET CAPITALIZATION.

Five years into the future is a long time, and no reasonable person should believe a single market participant will dominate all the following investment sectors: auto manufacturing, energy production, energy storage, rare earth mining, solar roof manufacturing, etc, etc.

All factors considered, in light of reality, TSLA valuation is presently based on the assumption that TSLA will not only dominate these investment sectors, but TSLA will be the only market participant, I.e., TSLA will participate without competition. Such a vision is absolute fantasy.

How many reasonable will continue to buy into this vision of the future?|

15 days ago•Last reply 13 days ago| TSLA Stock is currently at a price where a small number of large investors are able to sell their shares to the greater public including the ETF, 401K, and the like at a significant profit. becuase the price is so out of alignment with the stock market averages, they can take their time in order not to cause a panic drop. Once they have unloaded a majority of their positions, it will be up to the retail stock holders to keep the prices up instead of on the insitutional groups. unfortunately, retail holders cannot coordinate well enough and the institutions only need to increase their short positions to generate ALPHA profits (profits both directions.) Tesla is the perfect vehicle for this, a cult following and actually simple tech (batteries and electric motors) that can be made to appear like high tech rocket science. the averageinvestor just repeats meaningless techno jargon but has no real comprehension that battery tech has been around for two hundred years.|

If they do dominate it in the future, it will be a generation from now.Currently Tesla sells zero batteries. They projected a move to 100 GWh by 2022. That would be really cool. That would make them top 5, perhaps top 3. If they can find customers for 100GWh. Keep in mind, that they sell about 50GWh now. They would need to double their car sales or energy sales (they say they are supply constrained, so perhaps we will know in 18 months if that is true).Or, they could be late on that promise too . . . But they won't dominate the industry. Production is currently in the 400GWh range I believe. Going to 2TWh in a decade (well 5 GWh if you believe Tesla). There are not that many customers apparent yet.Guru.Guru.|

13 days ago•Last reply 13 days ago| As reality sets in, it’s becoming more and more clear the EVs will increase market share across the transportation sector. Nearly all vehicle manufacturers have EVs in production or nearing production stage.
TSLA/Musk groupies insist that none of these new EVs hitting the market can hold a candle to the “incredible TSLA.” Notwithstanding positive investor sentiment, traditional metrics tell a different story about TSLA’s stratospheric market capitalization.

Five years into the future is a long time, and no one should believe any single manufacturer will dominate any of the sectors: auto manufacturing, energy production, energy storage, mining, solar panel production, etc, etc.

All things considered, in light of reality, TSLA valuation is based on the assumption that TSLA will not just dominate these investment sectors, but will be the only market participant,
I.e., participate without competition.

How many reasonable people buy into this vision of the future?|
13 days ago•Last reply 13 days ago| George Soros said: "The main enemy of the open society, I believe, is no longer the communist but the capitalist threat."

George Soros said: "... the United States constitutes a serious threat to the peace and prosperity of the world."

In addition, George Soros frequently says he's on a mission to create one borderless, global "open society."

So, based solely on the stated beliefs and actual words of the radical, anti-U.S. George Soros, you clearly see the following: That George Soros considers the United States a totally unjust country; that George Soros considers American "capitalism" to be his "main enemy"; that George Soros thinks American "capitalism" is far worse than even "communism"; and that George Soros believes "the United States" is an extremely deadly "serious threat to the peace and prosperity of the world."

Those are the reasons that the extreme, anti-U.S. zealot George Soros gives for his obsessive mission to destabilize and dismantle the United States of America ....... during this Election Year. And that's why George Soros is spending almost all of his many tens of billions of dollars of wealth (that he earned in the U.S.) on doing exactly that.

Here is something that the extreme anti-U.S. George Soros (and his pals, the mainstream "fake-news" media, Marxist BLM/Democrat/Antifa, Hollywood, Pro-BLM pro sports leagues, Harris/Biden, far-left academia, and pro-BLM major corporations and social networks) definitely do not want you to know -- George Soros's entire Borderless Global Open-Society Master Scheme totally hinges on George Soros defeating President Trump in this election.

So wouldn't it be great for all American citizens to join together as one, re-elect President Trump, and totally stick it to that totally ungrateful, hateful, anti-U.S. George Soros?

Um, yep, you bet your aarhse it would.

P.S. George Soros's native Hungary and England have both accused George Soros of intentionally undermining and/or destabilizing their respective countries. Do you recognize a pattern there?|

I was more looking for plans to make a car affordable to the masses, because that is the common theme I found by the commenters on a YouTube video about the Model Y. And I got it, TSLA plans to have a $25K car within 3 years. This will be pivotal in reaching TSLA's goal of selling 20 million cars a year, and moving the world to a 100% EV world as TSLA wants.|

A taste of things to come:


Actual DMV registrations in real time for Norway (the most competitive EV market), Netherlands and Spain.

Poor tesla sales are DOWN 72% year to date compared to 2019....

If you have one $ invested in tesla you owe it to yourself to play around with the numbers on the website...

Than think...I mean REALY THINK... who has the second most competitive EV market? That's right, China...so PT Barnum builds a factory there. Sales are going so well they reduced the price...FACT...Sales are going so well, threw a newspaper leak, we find out boy genius is planning on selling units built in china in Europe. But wait... PT Barnum made a matter of fact statement that demand was so strong no cars would leave china.

Put those two together...what conclusion do you come to?|

13 days ago| Why Does A Stock Sometimes Sell-Off after A Stock Split?
Well, for one thing if you had 200 million shares as the float and you have a 5 for one split you end up with ONE BILLION shares as the new float size. So this can motivate people to sell more shares.
A higher number of shares can motivate people to sell some. Suppose someone only wanted to own 1000 shares of TESLA. Now they have 5000 shares. So they might sell 4000 or only half, 2500 shares.

The above has to do with what is well known as "The Psychology Of Investing".
Understanding some psychology can help you make better decisions.

Happy trading to all!

Stay safe.|

16 days ago| Looks like the battery hype was all#$%$ Now he needs come up with another story to sell.|
15 days ago•Last reply 13 days ago| I asked my hubby to use simple words to summarize the battery day.😅Here is his report:

Most important takeaways in the order of importance：

Battery Production
Tesla has completely reinvented battery production and design. Conventional process takes following steps
Mining company mines raw material (ores) from earth
Extraction company extracts minerals/metals from the ores.
Processing company process the minerals/metals to produce “High Grade” materials required for battery
A battery company uses these materials to manufacture cells

With the new innovations, Tesla has simplified this process
Mining company mines raw material (ores) from earth
Tesla takes the ores and process it to include in cells

This reduction in processing removes middlemen and significantly reduces cost. Since no other battery company has this technology, Tesla is easily 20 years ahead due patent protection.

Silicon
All convention rechargeable cells and batteries use graphite in cathode part of the cells. Graphite is nothing but a planar form of carbon, which is also used in pencil lead. Although graphite is common material on earth, silica (sand) is far more abundant. Further, extracting silicon from silica in large scale is well established by semi-conductor industry. Silicon is also not flammable, unlike graphite, which can burn. There are several advantages of using silicon, but has not been used as it can easily breakdown. Tesla has figured out a way to prevent this from happening. If it truly works, then this is an significant step forward in increasing power density

Integrated Design
Tesla is utilizing battery integrated in Aluminum frame as a structural material. Most cars are made with heavy material (e.g., iron and steel) to increase the weight. Increasing weight is necessary so that the car does flip or tumble when turning at high speeds (e.g., exit ramp on highways). For this reason, aluminum (which is lot cheaper and lighter) cannot be used. Tesla is using the battery’s weight and density to overcome the weight challenge with aluminum. This significantly reduces cost of structural material for cars.

Battery Design
Tesla also completely re-designed the architecture of cell. This again gives them lead against competitors by 10-20 years.|
13 days ago•Last reply 13 days ago| TSLA ENTIRE CAR MADE FROM FOSSIL FUELS. HAS TO BE PLUGGED INTO INFRASTRUCTURE THAT USES FOSSIL FUELS. DUMB|
13 days ago| I guess TSLA will close at 400, the market maker will pin TSLA at 400, and wipe call option any thing over 400.|
15 days ago•Last reply 13 days ago| Why are so many longs trying to convince you to stay invested in something that is 10x more expensive than it should be?

We can argue about the level of over valuation. Perhaps it is only 5x too expensive or 2x too expensive . . . but it is still too expensive.

You invest because there are gains to be had. If you believe that Tesla will sell 2MM cars in 2025 @ $30k each, that's $60 Billion in revenue. If they sell another $30 billion in battery (that's a really, really, really outlandish estimate), then you have 90 billion.

At 3x revenue you have $270 Billion market cap ... in 2025
At 5x revenue, you have a $450 billion market cap ... in 2025

But given these innovations are going to be widespread by then, book value will be a better estimate.

If they have 50 billion in book value by then . . . well we are at
1x book value . . . $50 billion
5x book value . . . $250 billion
10x book value . . . $500 billion.

Typical is 1x book value. 10x book value suggests that investors don't know how to invest for the next 4 years. That's not going to happen.

Tesla is too expensive by a wide margin. Why does everyone want everyone else to stay in?

13 days ago•Last reply 13 days ago| GOOD TSLA INFORMATION; The stock market is just speculation at this point. It has been overpriced for years. It is only a matter of time before investors realize that there is no value in this market. The forward PE Ratio on the S&P 500 is still around 25, and that is assuming 40% earnings growth/rebound. Even if the growth/rebound happens, who would invest with the principal returned every 25 years? Pressuring down won't last; it will soon be a stampede for the exits. The majority of youthful investors, and even businessmen, have never experienced a bear market, and invest as if every drop is another buying point. Sure, they will be surprised. October is traditionally a tricky month as is November, with investors harvesting their capital losses for tax purposes as the end of the tax year looms. There is no question however that a CV19 second wave return, as some European countries are seeing now carrying the risk of a second lockdown|

13 days ago| So we know they are going to beat their quarterly production targets, since Musk emailed they are going for a record. Is this priced in, or do we pop again when the numbers are released ?|
15 days ago•Last reply 13 days ago| Tesla said that they want to be producing 20MM cars in 10 years. This is essentially impossible. Not only did we get a lesson on battery materials last night (I have been making this point for some time), but we found out that there simply isn't enough supply to make that happen.

Let me help you out. Cars currently use about 5% of nickel supply. EVs (which isn't all cars, but work with me) represent about 2MM cars a year. If Tesla were selling 20MM cars a year, assume competition is selling 20MM cars a year, that's 40MM cars a year. That's 100% of Nickel supply . . . hmmm seems difficult for batteries to use up all of the nickel produced in the world. Prices will SKYROCKET!!

But let's go a bit further . . . currently there are about 80MM cars sold in the world in a typical year, median price somewhere around $25,000 (wow, where did Elon get that number from I wonder). Today, Tesla sells 500,000 cars a year (without competition right?! in reality 80% of EVs are sold by someone other than Tesla), but to get to 20MM with even 30% marketshare would imply that EVs sell 60MM cars a year. Does this seem reasonable in a market where only 80MM cars are sold a year? That 75% would be EVs in 10 years? It's unlikely.

Let's try that from another angle. Each factory that Tesla builds has cost about $2Billion and each one produces about 250,000 cars. Now let's say they get 100% better and each factory produces 500,000 cars. They now need 40 factories to get to 20MM cars a year . . . by 2030. That's $80 billion that they have to raise, build 4 factories per year and then find all of those customers.

Does any of this seem reasonable to you? It's just not possible . . . at all.

13 days ago•Last reply 13 days ago| FWIW, in the one little country where I look at daily data, Norway, VW is outselling Tesla by 300% on a daily basis now, and for the month, by over 200%.

They don't sell the ID.3 in North America, so Tesla has a little island of success to tout still, but competition is clearly (very clearly) taking a bite out of sales in the near term.

Do you remember that Dan Ives report suggesting the importance of markets like Norway and how important they will be fore Tesla? Well, the future for Tesla looks a lot smaller if you use that advice.

But you only want the 'positive' sides of the advice. It's called confirmation bias.

California Governor Gavin Newsom Bans Sale Of Gas-Powered Cars In State By 2035, Issues Executive Order To “Radically Change” Energy Consumption In State

,Deadline•September 23, 2020

These are articles on Yahoo Finance. I advise investors to pay heed to these articles. This is the tip of the iceberg. With battery technology getting better, improving by leaps and bounds, the days of gas guzzlers will go the way of the dinosaurs. Another big reason is that you will no longer need to go to gas stations and take a chance of catching covid - 19 by handling public pumps. Covid - 19 is now spiking again, and could explode worldwide. It is safer to charge your car in your garage , or driveway, than using gas stations. I respectfully suggest that when filling up your car, you wear gloves. Be safe, stay healthy .. everyone.|

13 days ago•Last reply 13 days ago| Top 10 Reasons to buy Tesla:

10. Leadership is all in. Elon Musk would buy his own stock at its peak just to burn shorts.
9. Options. Trucks, cars, and now semi-trucks....all with upgradeable features.
8. Improving the business process. Reducing overhead cost, Improving the battery performance.
7. A subscription model. What if Ford could sell you the truck and the gas. They can't. Tesla can. Charging stations are everywhere.
6. Great employees with access to Space X engineers.
5. Loved. The brand loyalty is insane.
4. Complete control of the customer experience. Who needs a dealership.
3. Low cost marketing.
2. Eventual inclusion in a major index.

And my top reason (drum roll).

1. Because my brother in law is a complete nitwit who everything he buys turns to doggy doo. He was screaming Nikola at the top of his lungs 2 months ago. He once bought Jumia (at 40) and rode it into the dirt. He's a complete moron who hates Tesla. Expect Tesla to go to the Moon. or should I say Mars.|

No one wins in the end. Those who work die with not enough time, and those who have it all die with still not enough time. Time is the one currency we don’t want to lose, but we cannot look too distantly in the future to see how much we have left. And since we don’t know the quantity, the best we can do is try to improve the quality to the best of our abilities. That’s why there is a devil’s arithmetic in working: you use up your time to get money to make the rest of your time more enjoyable, or even to add some time to your life. The risk is not adding enough quality to justify the quantity.|

Why Tesla’s Battery Day Will Actually Live Up to the Hype
Elon Musk will likely announce his EVs have finally become as cheap as conventional cars

Musk knows how to seize on that anxiety. On September 22, he will appear in a live webcast for Tesla “Battery Day,” a first-time-ever promotional event linked to the company’s annual shareholder’s meeting at its Fremont, California, factory. Batteries do not ordinarily excite mass anticipation, but Musk has teased that what he will reveal will “blow your mind.”

Yes, "blow your mind."|

TSLA’s in house “floor traders” have mastered the SHORT SQUEEZE. Skilled floor trading has driven TSLA share price to unsustainable levels.

In a nutshell, TSLA’s astronomical market capitalization is not product of investor demand, the normal cause of rising SP, but rather it’s a product of very skilled floor traders with very, very deep pockets.

PLEASE BE ADVISED: TSLA is vastly overvalued, but if you initiate a short sale expect to lose your investment and then some. Short sellers are seen as SITTING DUCKS to extremely skilled floor traders working to advance TSLA share price to even more unsustainable levels.

14 days ago•Last reply 14 days ago| A few Americans are still slightly confused about what the multi-billionaire George Soros is up to in the U.S.

Well, George Soros is an ardent anti-U.S. fanatic who made many tens of billions of dollars after he left his native Hungary and moved to New York City to work on Wall Street in the 1960s. So Soros made his many tens of billions of dollars in the United States. And now George Soros has dedicated virtually his entire vast wealth to diabolically destabilizing and totally dismantling the United States. Hmmm ... doesn't that sound remarkably like the constant anti-U.S. rantings of the extreme far-left radical anti-U.S. Democrat Ilhan Omar, who happens to be a U.S. Representative in Washington DC? Yes, it does.

George Soros has repeatedly and very angrily said that "The main obstacle to a stable and just world order is the United States."

Thus, the United States certainly seems to be George Soros's #1 Enemy (according to George Soros).

Soros has also expressed deep, hateful disdain for U.S. President George W. Bush and even far more vitriolic hatred for U.S. President Donald Trump.

As you can see, the extreme, far-left radical anti-U.S. attitude of George Soros perfectly matches up with the extreme far-left radical anti-U.S. attitude of today's Democrat Party ........ you know, the Democrat Party that desperately wants to "blow up the entire system!" (that's a direct quote from CNN Democrat news anchor Don Lemon from two nights ago, in his discussion with CNN far-left liberal Democrat Chris Cuomo about totally Abolishing and completely Eradicating the U.S. Electoral College). Surely, George Soros is licking his chops, desperately hoping the U.S. Electoral College is Demolished ASAP by the Soros-funded Democrat Party. All part of George Soros's Global Master Plan ....... George "Dr. Evil" Soros simply needs to get Harris/Biden elected to fully complete his Global Master Plan Vision over the next 1-2 years.|

14 days ago| NOVONIX Ltd (NVX.AX) and the Battery Revolution - Battery Day Response
Brisbane, Australia, Sep 23, 2020 - (ABN Newswire) - NOVONIX Limited (ASX:NVX) (HAM:GC3) (OTCMKTS:NVNXF) is pleased to provide the market with a response to some of key the topics discussed in TESLA's Battery Day event.

Today TESLA held its much anticipated Battery Day investor event and updated the world on progress in their battery technologies. The company touched on all aspects of cell manufacturing through to vehicle integration to outline a roadmap for an up-to 56% cost reduction in the final battery pack in a vehicle.

As expected, this event focused significantly on TESLA's internal project to develop cell manufacturing technology, which has been rumored since the acquisitions of companies such as Maxwell Technologies and Hibar Systems. In addition, TESLA presented briefly on its advances in battery materials.

NOVONIX's CEO Dr. Chris Burns, commented on the significance of the event and the importance for NOVONIX and the entire battery market:

"It was very exciting to listen to Elon and Drew discuss the advancements in TESLA's battery program. Their approach to rethinking battery cell manufacturing exactly aligns with NOVONIX's approach to rethinking battery materials manufacturing. Today's battery chemistry has proven itself for vehicles and energy storage systems, it just needs to be more affordable. The cost of production of cells and materials has been stuck on existing technology and there is opportunity to disrupt these sectors through re-engineered solutions. NOVONIX's anode material processing technology is one example of delivering lower cost, high performance graphite to support long cycle life applications, and Dry Particle Microgranulation (DPMG) is another as a process to eliminate waste water and use simpler metal inputs to reduce cathode manufacturing cost or improve yield in anode manufacturing. As highlighted in TESLA's presentation, the existing manufacturing cost of cathode is about 35% of the cost of the material and is far too expensive and wasteful, which is something NOVONIX has been saying since beginning the discussion around our DPMG technology. TESLA has promised very aggressive targets for the reduction in manufacturing costs through processing, and it will be exciting to see how close to these targets they can achieve over the coming years and continue to be a part of this industry's supply chain for the years to come."

"TESLA briefly presented on the use of silicon as the anode material in cells. I believe they felt it important to touch on all aspects of the process from cell manufacturing, to anode and cathode materials, to pack assembly. The industry has known for more than a decade that silicon can store more lithium and can therefore support lower-cost-per-energy materials than graphite. However, it is well known that this comes with the downside of shortened cycle life. The swelling of the material causes it to break down during cycling and continually react with the electrolyte, which shortens the lifetime of the cell. Many companies have claimed to fix this problem but none have been able to demonstrate anywhere near the cycle life of graphite-based chemistries (thousands of cycles). Given the emphasis by TESLA on the need for long life in vehicle and grid, as well as how important grid will be to the future, the benefits of attempting to switch to an unproven silicon chemistry for a modest 5% of their proposed 56% pack cost reduction seems far too high of a risk at this time. I think it is clear that graphite will remain a key part of battery chemistries for years to come."

"TESLA's presentation discussed a key issue around the cathode that NOVONIX has been highlighting over the past number of months; the manufacturing method is too complex, wasteful and costly. Our proprietary DPMG technology is a perfect example of how NOVONIX's approach to re-engineering battery materials manufacturing processes will play a key role in the future growth of the battery industry. DPMG eliminates wastewater, does not require expensive sulfate inputs, is highly compatible to recycled materials and allows process control over the product for optimized material production at low cost. This type of simplified process reduces capital expenditures, lowers plant footprint, and decreases operating cost which all translate to a lower cost final product. As NOVONIX has continually asserted, it is clear that high nickel cathode materials will play a key role in the growth of the battery sector and lower cost, advanced manufacturing methods, such as DPMG, are well positioned to support the industry's required growth and cost-efficiencies."

The NOVONIX team and proprietary technologies complements the amazing work by TESLA and we look forward to continuing to participate in the advancement of the state of lithium-ion battery technology. NOVONIX continues to work on delivering lower cost materials to support million|

14 days ago•Last reply 14 days ago| Fox News = George Soros?

Everyone knows the indisputable fact that the U.S. mainstream "fake-news" media (MSM) is completely in the bag for the Democrat Party. Try going on any MSM fake-news show and simply mention that the multi-billionaire George Soros donates huge dollar amounts to Democrat politicians, weak soft-on-crime Democrat DA's throughout the country, and various other radical far-left causes in the U.S. ... and the MSM show hosts and reporters will instantly gang up and silence you, angrily cut off your mic (Don Lemon regularly does this), or instantly cut to a commercial break.

People likewise know the only news channel that at least gave Republicans a fair shake was Fox News. Until this week. Republican Newt Gingrich was the guest on a Fox News show this week and merely mentioned to the three co-hosts that the multi-billionaire George Soros has been heavily financing BLM/Antifa, U.S. Democrat politicians, and various extreme far-left anti-Trump and anti-U.S. causes. But the Fox News co-hosts weren't having any of it, instantly pouncing on Gingrich, quickly shouting him down and silencing him. At that point, Gingrich fell into total stunned quietude, and all four people on that show, including the host, fell into awkward silence for about a half-minute, with the main host of the show, Harris Faulkner, suddenly in intense focused concentration as she stared off into space. Then she very lightly whispered into her microphone/headset (and I quote): "........ alright? ......... we're good? ............. okay? ............. (now far louder and very emphatic) We're Going To Move On Now! ... Uh ..... Uh .... Historic day at the White House! ... (moves onto a completely different news segment and totally leaves the shocked Gingrich hanging) ..."

So it certainly seems the multi-billionaire George Soros has bought out Fox News, too. Certainly appears to be a total protection racket -- now throughout the entire U.S. mainstream media -- for the multi-billionaire anti-U.S. George Soros ...... whose name shall not be uttered in public!

Maybe George Soros was exactly right when he wrote in one of his books that he egomaniacally thinks of himself as and "... consider [himself] some kind of god, the creator of everything, but I feel comfortable about it now since I began to live it out."

Good to know ............ during this Election Year.|

This is nothing but SHORT sellers posting like crazy trying to bait the longs into a panic or frenzied sell off. Tesla made a lot of people into millionaires. They are still millionaires. Why should you panic if your long by as little as a month you’ve made a huge gain at today’s levels.
We still have S&P sooner or later, Battery day will EVENTUALLY be understood for its true potential. Analysts are slow to learn.
Quarterly results coming soon and they will be good.
Berlin and Austin coming on line Freemont gets a revision into making the new tables dry cell cheaper more efficient battery Elon stating a 10x increase in output. eliminating any production constraints that they might have had. So look out Semi, Power Wall, and Cyber Truck

Only way is if they were involved in some kind of scandal, and they are far to professional to be caught up in something like that. They are the future, and what Elon is doing is making sure profits yield the most possible. Also I’ve noticed more and more of these cars on the street. It’s gotten to the point where I see one on every drive and man do they scream buy me. All Elon’s plans are rolling around and it won’t be long till he releases a “car update” where you do a 15-30 minute download to fix the auto summon feature.|

The aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that Trump is panicking over a doomsday scenario in which Americans, sidelined during the 2016 election, play a dominant role in influencing the 2020 contest. “It sounds paranoid, but, as we speak, representatives of the United States are already plotting to remove him from office in 2020,” the aide said. “They are determined to replace him with someone who takes a move favorable view toward their country.”|

14 days ago•Last reply 14 days ago| Liberal Democrats promise American voters that, if Biden wins the Election, they will quickly:

* Change the law and pack the Supreme Court with up to "27" Supreme Court Justices (resulting in 23 far-left activist Democrat Justices, 3 conservative Justices (Gorsuch, Alito, Thomas), and 1 swing-vote Justice (Chief Justice Roberts). The "27" Justices quote is directly from a far-left Rutgers University Democrat law professor. Other leading Democrats are intensely pushing for victorious Democrats to pack the U.S. Supreme Court with at least another "9" far-left activist Justices ASAP.

* Pack the U.S. Senate by quickly making Washington DC a state (thus adding two more far-left U.S. Senators to the Senate) and Puerto Rico as well (also adding two more Democrat Senators) and split California into three states (thus adding four more extreme far-left U.S. Senators) and ... that is called Senate packing ...

* Abolish the Electoral College. You respond: That's impossible because it requires a Constitutional Amendment. But a President Biden (or U.S. President Kamala) and Democrat takeover of the Senate easily enables the BLM/Antifa-controlled Democrat Party to quickly pass that Constitutional Amendment to totally eradicate the Electoral College. That guarantees that far-left Democrats will win all future Presidential elections and firmly control all three branches as well as all the Appeals Courts across the U.S. Why else do you think all Democrats (including Harris/Biden) want to quickly Eradicate the long-standing Electoral College?

Thus, the far-left Democrats have complete Master Plans for the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S Presidency, and the U.S. Senate. Given that Democrats already control the House, they don't currently promise any urgent action on the U.S. House of Representatives .......... yet.|

14 days ago•Last reply 14 days ago| I have received some requests about the topping process which I so very correctly called going into the split. I described the process , in some detail over a period of quite a few days leading right up to the top. And I characterized the indicators I was seeing as being "historic" in nature. The questions I have received are regarding that.
By "historic" , I meant and still mean exactly that. This is not to say that at some time in the distant future, that TSLA shares cannot eclipse that top that was reached in the $500 ish area, but it will likely be a VERY long time from now, almost certainly not this year. That is what I meant by historic. IT was a confluence of events and money flow that just does not take place often, and it was based on pie in the sky completely unrealistic hype, not hype in the sense that the story was eternally impossible, but what was being developed in the "whisper" were truly unrealistic and actually silly time frame expectations. We now see that they were and that the big money, including MANY TSLA insiders were selling shares hand over fist. So what is happening since that top is what must happen. TSLA will have plenty of rallies and sell offs , but will likely fall far short of that lofty top for quite some time to be....................
Note I am not saying that TSLA shares will crash and go to where the extremist bashers will claim, it is just that the upside is one heck of a lot more limited than the extremist pumpers state , who , imho were even more extreme and silly than the extreme bashers...........|

Being able to sustain above these two levels means the low a few days ago and today would be good entry points back into tech stocks. If so, we should see a significant bounce to the 11.5K+ level.

huge market rebound tomorrow.

14 days ago| Tesla’s stock price assumes perfection for the next 10 years... Tesla is the most valuable car company in the world thanks to its soaring stock price. But Toyota and VW each delivered ~30X more cars than Tesla did in 2019, when it delivered 50% more vehicles than it did in 2018. To deliver 20M by 2030 assumes Tesla would have to keep growing at that fast rate for 10 years. Hyper-fast growth, especially in manufacturing, is usually not sustainable for that long — so it's unlikely. But if Tesla pulls it off, then its current $350B valuation will be worth it.|
