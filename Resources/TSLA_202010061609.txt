low ( for TSLA) open interest and dollar value , combined with LDV being not far from current price makes this week's oct 9 option expiration a relatively SMALL factor in the shareprice dynamic this week. Next week oct 16 is a different story, likely a more significant effect but not as huge as we have seen for a monthly. The big one , a truly monumental potential effect and test for the TSLA shareprice dynamic is the former leap jan 15 2021 expiration. Will look to post more about that in the future.
Also seeing SIGNIFICANT indicators further confirming that the "historic" confluence of hyperbullish story effect leading to the predicted top in the immediate post split timeframe , which was marked in a premarket session at the aprox $533 will be truly a very durable top in the at least the short term, further enhancing my many times expressed view that the Extreme pumpers who predict huge upside moves in the next few months, are to be ignored.......................!

4 hours ago•Last reply 37 minutes ago!! How many companies have growth 36%

Tesla's prospective growth in Unit volume this year is 36%. Their revenue won't grow so much due to the increasing share of the Model 3 (lower average sales prices), but I did a quick look at companies on the Nasdaq with growth (in revenue) of > 36%.

Of the 3,686 Nasdaq companies I compared,
1308 companies had growth of less than 36%
454 companies reported revenue growth of greater than 36% (highest was tiny GNFT with 44,594% growth)
1,924 didn't have data, or didn't calculate growth (i.e. ETFs, Preferreds, and stocks with negative growth)

That leads to the question, why is Tesla so special? They don't make money. There is a low probability for excellent margins/earnings. The company has broad and deeply entrenched competition.

Where is the magic? I have heard all of the major arguments: Batteries, EV growth, Veblen goods, Autonomous platform. I think I have discounted all of those as (mostly) pie in the sky (and Tesla's end markets look like they are coming to the same conclusion), so what is the magic?

Respectful replies are appreciated.

Thanks,

Where is the magic? I have heard all of the major arguments: Batteries, EV growth, Veblen goods, Autonomous platform. I think I have discounted all of those as (mostly) pie in the sky (and Tesla's end markets look like they are coming to the same conclusion), so what is the magic?

Respectful replies are appreciated.

Thanks,

From CNN's Betsy Klein
White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany appeared to downplay the possibility of a presidential address as soon as Tuesday, saying “no decision had been made.”

“He certainly does want to address the nation at some point. But in terms of timing of that, certainly no plans as of today, but I think they’re always fast moving so should that change, we’ll be sure to let you know,” she said during an appearance on Fox Business.
McEnany noted that Trump has been seen “on camera each and every day since he contracted the Covid-19 virus, and I’ll bet you’ll see him in some form today.”.!

2 hours ago!! I just saw a headline that made me laugh: "The Trade Desk is Very Extended and Looks Vulnerable Again."

As a TTD investor since 2017, I actually agree with this article. TTD's current PE ratio is at 240, which is extremely high, even for a high growth company. What made me laugh is that if TTD is very extended, TSLA is the balloon on the verge of popping. TSLA currently has a PE ratio of just under 1100! So let's see if their growth rate warrants this valuation and compare it to TTD's. I'm talking about revenue growth, by the way, not delivery growth. Starting in 2017, TSLA's annual revenue increased by 68%, 83%, and 15%. Trailing 12 month growth ending 2Q2020 was only 3%. TTD's annual revenue increased by 52%, 55%, and 39%. TTM growth was 21%. The spike in TSLA's growth in 2017 and 2018 was due to increased deliveries of the Model S/X, which were 101k and 99k, respectively. 2018 also had 245k Model 3 deliveries. So what caused the drop from 83% growth to only 15%? Model S/X deliveries fell off the cliff, and that trend continues this year. So what Telsa has done is sacrifice revenue growth for delivery growth. They continue to do that this year, lowering their prices several times, including a recent 8% drop in China. Tesla then is no longer a high growth company by any means, at least in terms of revenue. Even if Tesla is able to deliver 500k this year, which is extremely unlikely given that they will need to deliver 181k in the fourth quarter, revenue growth would be less than 20%. With fewer sales of their high end vehicles, margins will be constricted. They also front loaded much of the regulatory credit sales in the first two quarters, so they will not have very many for the rest of this year. That too will hurt their margins. Look for their PE ratio to increase, rather than decrease, in the foreseeable future..!

yesterday•Last reply 3 hours ago!! Today in Norway, 261 EVs were sold. 9 of those were Tesla vehicles. (3.4%)
For the month so far in Norway, 924 EVs were sold. 19 of those were Tesla vehicles. (2%)
For the year so far in Norway, 54,503 EVs were sold. 3,524 of those were Tesla vehicles (6.4%)

As competition enters markets, Tesla's market share tends to decline.

If the world buys 5MM EVs in 2025 and Tesla only has 6.4% share, that is only 320,000 vehicles.
Let's triple it!! Let's say they end up with 20% share . . . that's 1MM vehicles . . . in 2025.

It could go better, it could go worse.

3 days ago•Last reply 3 hours ago!! For traditional car makers to compete with Tesla they need to dedicate 100% of their engineering focus on developing EV cars. They can’t do that for one simple reason, their cash cow is still selling ICE cars so they still have to maintain engineering on those areas until they get to the point where their EV is ready for prime time. So in other words they can’t so now they are splitting their engineering to ICE and EV base case 50% each and trying to compete with Tesla with 100% of their engineering resources and money on EV....who do you think is going to win? Another advantage Tesla has is they have all these other areas that they do business in and the engineering in those cross pollinate to other areas of business, I suspect making new metals came from Spacex, making indestructible glass bled thru solar roof tiles. And break through in power wall probably improved the battery and bled thru the cars. That is the competitive advantage of Tesla engineering. The traditional ICE companies don’t stand a chance..!

Even good companies with big industrial value fell to nothing. I lost aaaall the money that I made in 1999- 2000. I didn't understand how irrational things had become. Just like you people holding Tesla. That's why I say to you now: SELL. Because Tesla is a 40bln Company, not 400. I will make a fortune on the downfall, but it doesn't have to be your money, that I make. You don't have to be poor, you can sell and be happy.

To avoid your broker from "lending your shares to short sellers" put a sell order for $2000 or something to high to be reached on your TSLA stock, This prevents your shares from being lent out by the broker because there is a sell contact on them..!
5 hours ago!! Tesla's China sales numbers should be available in a few days, but some other Chinese vendors are highlighting their figures already. For future comparison, here are the numbers for three US listed Chinese automakers:

Sept Q3 YTD
NIO 4,708 12,206 26,375
XPeng 3,478 8,578
Li Auto 3,504 8,660 18,168

These companies all grew quickly, but from a very small base. I am also waiting for the Wuling numbers as the low end market leader, it will be interesting to see if the excitement holds for another month (or two).

The next quarters' results and confirmation of 500k deliveries for the year, which I believe is already in the bag (I expect c.20,000 were held back from the last numbers to make sure) will lead to a final capitulation by short sellers in March 2021 as there will be virtually no shares for sale to cover. Tesla will become FCF positive even with new model launches from a successful ride hailing division and a major battery technology breakthrough..!

verb

seek to harm, intimidate, or coerce (someone perceived as vulnerable).

Elon Musk was seriously bullied as a child. It hasn’t stopped yet. Only now that he’s a blazingly successful billionaire it’s gotten worse. His powerful detractors are huge industrial competitors, regulatory bodies and some vicious media. It will continue as he perennially disrupts other legacy factions. He’s often stated he’s not in all this for the wealth and fame. It’s proven by his continued doubling, down mostly with his own resources. His loyal investors are and will continually be richly rewarded..!
6 hours ago•Last reply 6 hours ago!! Tesla dropping prices was big mistake. Huge drop in margins just to try and meet a yearly sales goal is foolish. Hurting Q4 EPS and likely negative earnings is a poor decision by management to try and get to 500k cars sold.

If the EU etc is devaluing the Euro etc at the same rate the US is destroying the dollar with all of this stimulus, no harm.

If the US is largely out printing others, there will be a huge reckoning in the US. The Fed never shook of the $4 trillion it put on the balance sheet for the 2009libinduced financialcrisis.

And with thelibs looking to unfairly forgive all current student debt, provide free college, free healthcare (the only reason healthcare is so expensive now is because the government got involved) and other free insane policies, we could reallybephecked.

I keep spending more and more money on it every time it drops. Hoping that it will rebound I Was a Fool to buy it at 474. Now I'm sitting at 430 and still can't see green. I have a chance to put my $ into DraftKings instead I wasted it here I could have been in the green a long time ago with DraftKings instead I believed in somebody else's dream who is making my life a nightmare.. it is sad over and over to every time I open this app I see this stock go down again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again.

2 days ago•Last reply 6 hours ago!! Elon said value Tesla by “ The number of vehicles sold + the value of autonomy”. So what is the value of production 1 million vehicles every year probably starting next year. What is the value of autonomy, that is a bit harder to quantify but for me autonomy is going to fetch premium price as long as Tesla is the only one that has it so based on how behind everyone else is, I give it 10 years before everyone catches up. This will mean Tesla will completely dominate the industry and autonomous vehicle will be valued at premium. So $4000 in 3 years is very realistic and conservative..!

Here are some of the key highlights about the benefits from this deal.

ImagineAR has access to ALL NFL Alumni players in which they can’t utilize them for revenue generating campaigns, events, promotions, etc.
NFL “Academy” is just beginning. This is the kickoff so to speak. ImagineAR will significantly be involved in this launch.
Significant revenue to be made from this deal and the bread crumbs it will generate. Put this into perspective everyone. When will TOM BRADY retire!? ImagineAR will work together on sponsorship branding campaigns for any NFL Alumni player member for the next 5 years.
Sponsorship money for players, 37 chapters, brands, monetize sale of unique content. Lots of money to be made over the next 5 years.
So in summary, sounds pretty EPiC to me! And let’s be honest, this is AP we are talking about...I’m sure there will be lots more to come and very soon.!

Final numbers could vary by up to 0.5% or more. Tesla vehicle deliveries represent only one measure of the company’s financial performance and should not be relied on as an indicator of quarterly financial results, which depend on a variety of factors, including the cost of sales, foreign exchange movements and mix of directly leased vehicles.".!

The Model Y is almost certainly not '100% recommended' by all that own it. In fact there are a large number of quality issues reported over many months now, and here are the highlights (published on some of the biggest Tesla fan news sites, NHTSA and The Verge):

1. The stock keeps moving up but I would give that a less probability of the other 2.
When I refer to moving up at the clip that's been traveling. ( This could make a new all time high but I don't see it smashing the old one! aka .25 - $ 50.00 over the previous high. I would'nt count on that senario!
2. The stock moves sideways for the next 3 to 5 years. Look at tesla from 2014 - 2019!
3. The stock crashes down like the year 2000! Then another 10 plus years to catch up to this old ATH. MSFT is a great example.

8 hours ago•Last reply 8 hours ago!! Comparing Tesla sales to VW and Renault in Germany.

The result is inconclusive, but the author suggests that the Renault ZOE was the best seller in Germany in September with 3,600 units, the Tesla Model ID.3 in second or 3rd with 3,065 and the ID.3 somewhere close to these two.

"The obvious BEV candidate that may have achieved more German sales in September is the Volkswagen ID.3. We know that the newcomer scored a strong 1989 unit sales in Norway in September. Could the ID.3 have garnered over 3,600 unit sales in the homeland? It seems very possible, but we don’t yet have any solid data one way or another.

What we can say is that the Renault ZOE scored 3,600 sales, the Tesla Model 3 got close to 3,000 sales, and the VW ID.3 probably got close to these two, if not higher. Other recent favourite BEVs in Germany have reliably included the VW e-Golf; Hyundai Kona; VW e-Up!; Audi e-tron; Smart Fortwo; and BMW i3. The VW e-Golf still likely has some inventory to move, but will obviously soon bow out to the VW ID.3. All the other recent favourites will likely have made good sales in September as usual."

12 hours ago•Last reply 8 hours ago!! Why Tesla will remain 10+ years ahead of the curve.
The problem with current car manufacturers is it takes them years to make changes to a PART due to the structure of how decisions are made in the company and how those parts are dependent on outside companies to decide and eventually make the changes. So a typical car part will approximately take 5 to 6 years to be updated because it has to go thru a board and decided on which 80% of ideas die if it did succeed and submitted to the car parts manufacturer and they also have to decide if it is worth for them to make those changes as they also have other car customers to deal with. So even if they stream line the company decision making process they still have to deal with the manufacturer. Tesla based on the changes experts have seen in all their past cars only takes approximately 6 months to change a part because it is vertically integrated. Currrently there are no car companies who can make changes to a part in 6 months..!

yesterday•Last reply 10 hours ago!! Bond yields are rising today. This probably isn't a big deal given how low yields are, but if yields rise substantially (and they may if there is market/election turmoil), then the markets are likely to come down with bonds.

One thesis is that all of this easy money will allow governments to subsidize EVs and prop up markets, but there are growing cracks in that story. Tesla is dramatically reliant on people who feel good about their finances and thankful for government incentives to continue selling a lot of cars.

After the election, some leader will have to reacquaint themselves with the tax system that is unable to cover the cost of running the USA. The same is true for Europe, where countries like Italy may simply be unable to pay their bills soon (it would have been more obvious without COVID, but still... they're broke).

And China's growth rate is down to 3.2%! Pundits have long suggested they need 7% just to stave off social unrest. What's next? I don't know, but the cracks are starting to show in the consumption based economy and luxury goods (like Tesla) often suffer lower demand during downturns.

Not saying that will happen now, or next week, but after the election there is likely going to be a reckoning of some sort.

Depending on how the numbers look and if they revise their full year numbers down then it could be a sharp decline. If they keep the delivery numbers for the year then 470 should be the turning point. It will not go to 500 and above, not on an election month!.!

Biden winning will be the greatest thing for Tesla, since he’ll push for a some kind of green new deal. We’ve seen what Trump did to the great economy the Obama left him with. He destroyed it. And don’t blame it all on covid, many industries were going downhill before then..!

2 days ago•Last reply 17 hours ago!! My earnings estimate is for about $210MM without Regulatory credits. It's based on the following:

1. 139,300 vehicles sold at $53,000 ASP. (ASP last quarter was $56,980 ex. Regulatory Credits)
2. 20% gross margin (last quarter was 18.4% GM ex. Regulatory Credits)
3. $400MM for energy gen/storage
4. $500MM for service & other
5. Loss of 10MM on these two aspects of the business. They lost 50MM here last quarter.
6. $375MM for R&D (R&D was really light last quarter, expect a return to spending, given the raise)
7. $700 for SG&A given the two factories under construction and increased sales
8. $170MM for interest expense (I didn't look at changes to the balance sheet for changes to debt)
9. $25MM for other expenses (This is just a guess).

That leaves $207MM for retained earnings. Of course if any regulatory credits are brought into revenue, then the number will increase proportionately.

Any other guesses?

18 hours ago•Last reply 17 hours ago!! I keep wondering real motive behind Tesla Battery day since I saw on that day.

First most of stuff look so simple and obious that it's not really break though and any expert would have thought and tried.

My biggest wonder is, we know Toyota, VW, BMW, GM, Mercedes all claiming they have Solid State battery technology. I don't think Tesla taking it lightly. They either contract with same company (Like QuantrumScape or some other) But mean time coming up with new way to use old battery chemistry just to inflate stock while powerful people book profit and exit.

Toyota already have prototype and road map for solid state battery. Mercedes giving solid state battery option to their Bus in production vehicle. VW claiming 2025 for mass production..

So Elon can come out in 2023 or 2024 saying Solid State battery technology come long way in last few years and it does not make sense to persue this battery pack and so changing plan and then create another hoax to replace it.

Amazing if market continue buy all those Hoax one after another with very clear motive. I don't care if those convertible holder lose everything because they deserve to lose but in real world, those convertible holder are most powerful group out there and THey going to bring down many many different stock to ground as soon as they start hedging again while minting billions after billions and getting even powerful.

Remember most powerful bear group is convertible holder and be careful..!

Hardly bullish, while he did offer subsidies which I'm sure anyone in his position would do by default. He tried to justify the continuation of ICE vehicles stating that EVs hardly make a difference.

21 hours ago!! I usually don’t look at forums specifically because of the conversations you see here.

Anyways, I missed the first train to millions with tesla. I recently bought in 36 shares at 400$. (Its all I could afford without effecting any other finances and still being comfortable).

For those of you newer here than I am, i’ve noticed tesla has crazy swings and it’s pretty exciting watching your money fluctuate. I could imagine the anxiety for people with much more shares than I have.

I’m here for the long haul and hopefully for the positive side of the outcome. We may lose some days but ultimately I think I made the right “investment” no matter how many of these trolls and shorties say otherwise!

if only these republicons did the right thing and everyone could receive treatment and attention like trump did then there wouldn't be this economic disaster.

yesterday•Last reply 23 hours ago!! I think this is one of the most overvalued auto companies in History!
They produced 139,200 cars for the quarter by my calculations they will make between 9.2 - 9.3 billion in revenue for this quarter and analysis that are pumping this stock have 8.3 billion for revenue for this quarter. They are purposely making the numbers low so they can keep beating!
How can people value this company more than Toyota, VW, and a few other auto companies combined?
I believe this company is trading at premiums that are unsustainable!

yesterday•Last reply yesterday!! Howdy folks!
What are your thoughts on Elon Musk? 12 trauches of compensation.
According to my estimates he will end up with over 100 million more shares creating more dillution. On top of the 3-5% share dillution currently. at the current nose bleed market cap right now there dilution rates are almost equal to there revenue. Ok by next year tsla will probably bring in around 52 - 55 billion in revenue if all goes as planned. Still at 8 x next years salses is very very high for a auto company!
Last time I checked tsla revenues 85% came from selling cars!
That makes them a auto company!
Plus they buy there batteries from other companies.
Eventually they will produce there own batteries.
Eventually there competitors will also produce there own batteries.
Do you really think Germany is going to stand buy and let tesla dominate them. I don't think so. Look at world war 2 germans are fighters! VW and Toyota will contiue to dominate the markets not to mention Gm, F etc.
competitiion is coming in the next 1 or 2 and they will be able to compete with tsla.
Tesla has a year advantage at best right now. I will be genours and say 18 months max..!

From CNN's Dana Bash
President Trump, who is at Walter Reed medical center, is saying, “I need to get out of here," a source familiar with the President’s phone calls today tells CNN.

CNN is told that the President is being warned that, politically speaking, if he rushes to leave the hospital and then has a setback it would be really bad for him — not just health wise, but also for his campaign.

Overall, the President is sounding very upbeat and healthy on the phone, according to the same source..!

yesterday•Last reply yesterday!! I have a question for everyone here?
First off this is one of the biggest auto industry bubbles in history!
Why are these analyses coming up with a low Q 3 number of 8.3 billion!
139,300 for the quarter puts the number around 9.2 - 9.3 billion in revenue!
Yes, that's a beat but with the current market cap, I would say the current price more then justifies that beat!
I think the current market cap is already baked into the next 5 years of growth!
All thoughts are welcome

8 days ago•Last reply yesterday!! Forecast: NIO will soon enter into new all time highs. Higher 20s and lower 30s are within the reach based on valuation. This is based on recent developments, production forecast, ER forecast, growing demand etc. NIO will play a very big role in China's EV growth and lead in many ways. In short term price can be manipulated, fluctuate due to many reasons but long term players will be the real winners. According to the forecast NIO will show it's potential in Q4 which could be the start of market "disruption" in China. My analysis also shows that NIO could be the first manufacturer to bring Level 5 autonomous driving car to consumers not Tesla with the help of Mobileye. Sandy Munro is getting amused by Tesla's grade 12 battery day presentation and talks highly about autonomous driving circuit board, obviously he hasn't pulled out a circuit board of computer or server. Wall Street was pumping Tesla saying it has the greatest autonomous driving software but Elon Musk revealed on battery day that they had to rewrite the whole program from scratch. If Tesla can rewrite autonomous driving software then brands like NIO and VW group can write a new program. However working together with Mobileye and sharing data is the best way to take autonomous driving to the next level as there have to be common protocols to be followed when it comes to CONNECTED CARS. NIO recently hired someone with magic hands to develop it's own autonomous driving software. So what's the biggest issue with Tesla's battery day? Tesla hasn't created a new battery technology, it has redesigned its own battery cell. This is is not a new idea. We all know very low power consumption devices use AAA batteries and high power consumption devices use batteries like AA, LR14 LR20 etc in normal household devices. The battery technology that we have today will change in future, chemicals in them will change to make EV more safer, so by the time Tesla get to where it's planning to get competitors will unleash some amazing solutions and technology. NIO is safe in every way because of battery swap technology. Blue Sky coming! Just believe in it. $tsla $xpeng $li.!

yesterday•Last reply yesterday!! Tesla was one of the first-movers into EV market and no doubt it revolutionized battery technology. Tesla cars are fast, reliable and fun to drive. But Elon has some shortcoming that he should learn from and improve. E.g. he wants to do everything all by himself which is very resource demanding. He should cooperate more and acquire or invest heavily in some of key suppliers. He should do it fast because once German catch up, it will be difficult to outpace them..!

September Sales (2020) 18,522; (2019) 19290; (4% drop in sales)
Q3 Sales (2020) 30,081; (2019) 26,786 (12% increase in sales)
YTD Sales (2020) 64400; (2019) 75648 (14.9% drop in sales)

For the YTD number, COVID is clearly having an impact, but September shows what happens when the competition enters the market. The PoleStar started selling at the end of August and the ID.3 delivered their first vehicles in the last days of August as well.

Competition is coming.

yesterday•Last reply yesterday!! doubled my shortposition this morning, european time. On the back of 20 years experience, I think we are close to that irrational og rational reason we need to start the collapse of tesla and stocks in general. Obvious that everything is manipulated, and Tesla is the most manipulated of them all. Looking for a 90 % fall. This fall. :).!
yesterday!! They using Cramer now to keep stock price high. Just amazing he was joking when stock keep going higher at 1000 pre split level that People say it's raining, I am buying Tesla, it's cloudy , I am buying tesla....

Now he coming out to defend same stock that is twice as much in just matter of month.

I think Big powerful Convertible holder, working hard to hedge their bonds and taking all puppet help to achieve that.

Using those clown at extreme level mean they having hard time finding bigger fool.

Don't get trapped here. This is very very over price stock and all hoax are gone. Only one left which FSD.

yesterday!! Lots of things I want to say about Tesla.

Lets start with self driving.

For this this to work reliably in most weather conditions, I think that some form of vehicle to vehicle communication would be mandatory. There would also be a need for some sort of beacon system for disabled vehicles, lane obstructions, or similar hazards that could not be reliably detected. All manufacturers would need to be on board, and any local authority that allowed autonomous driving would need to make sure that all authorized routes within their jurisdiction met certain standards.

This will take time, which will allow autopilot will improve, and eventually we will be able to legally and safely sleep behind the wheel on restricted access roads like interstates. At that point, I can see paying Elon's car to drive me from interchange A to interchange B so that I can avoid the most boring part of my trip.

As far as the current plan is concerned (revenue from self driving on unrestricted highways, roads, interchanges, residential streets, and the like), It's going to be a long time before it's technically, logistically, and legally possible..!
yesterday•Last reply yesterday!! Tesla is out of gas. The supply of #$%$ and dreamers that will pay any price based on future expectations is waning. If they actually had a chance at monopolizing self-driving, then the current valuation might come true twenty years from now. But they don't, they are in the same boat as everybody else, trying to solve the same problems the same way and they have lost engineering talent to serious competitors. This stock is going to $80 in five years..!
yesterday•Last reply yesterday!! Loving Tesla and not loving the stock are not mutually exclusive. I think Tesla is amazing and would love to own one, but the value of the company is just not in the realm of reality.!

yesterday•Last reply yesterday!! I still believe most of tech stocks are overvalued. But that is just one factor in equation. First, stocks were put to test in September which makes another correction less probable. Second, fiscal policies and huge number of investors helps the market to continue its bullish rally..!

yesterday!! Hey Shorts, don't you ever get tired of always being on the outside looking in?.!
yesterday•Last reply yesterday!! JP Morgan Ryan Brinkman raised Tesla target from $65 to $75? What a joke? He knows his record is so ugly the last couple of years by constantly rating Ford and JM a buy and Tesla a sell. He knows he lost his credit so if he comes out with another sell rating he will be humiliated by the market again. So he changed a strategy by saying he is raising Tesla's target to catch eye balls to show his true bearish color.
But IMO no matter how many ways he tries he can not change the fact the Tesla is new industrial revolution company and accelerating.

Oh by the way JP Morgan also recommends Nikola as a buy. lol. So it seems JP Morgan is not only trying to save GM and Ford. As long as it is anti-Tesla they recommended it (enemy's enemy is friend?). Just as Jay Lano said "I don't understand why some people hate Tesla, it is doing great things"..!

4 days ago•Last reply yesterday!! Real Deal W here, just checking in to answer questions from my followers
Note that even if we had not gotten the news of the Trump Covid, that TSLA , while likely to have been up today, it would not have been up hugely. It probably would have peaked around $455 or so and then sold off into the close modestly. The extremists would have been wrong even if no Trump covid. And the option expiration to look forward to is the oct 16 one, which is where most of the bigger players in options placed their bets rather than the weekly oct 2 and 9. And the LDV for that one is considerably lower than the current price. It is going to be interesting! ( as TSLA usually is).!

Love to see the beautifully restored antique, vintage, rare, unique, custom, muscle and period cars. But at the same time can’t help but in think how they have little or no safety features and emissions mediations of the newer vehicles. As a hobby they are delightful. As day to day transportation they are a NTSB nightmare. Their century old “beta” phase cost millions of lives. Seat belts, child safety seats, air bags, padded dash’s, electronic stability control, crumple zones, fire control design are just a few of the safety features included in the new cars. I loved and miss my ‘64 GTO but wouldn’t feel safe today driving it to a 7-11..!

2 days ago•Last reply yesterday!! Just finished my Tesla test drive an hour ago. It’s hard to understand the company without driving the car first hand. The acceleration, efficiency, use,... were surprisingly disappointing.

I asked the salesman at the tesla dealership if I could take the model y SUV off the road.

With a lisp he said the model y is a "crothover' it has a hatchback, but you can't take it off road, it might damage the tablet duct taped to the dash". He continued, "the model X is our SUV".

I said "ok let"s take one of those out for an off road test drive".

He said, "you can't take our SUV off road, you'll void the warranty, the battery pack can't take the vibration and it could fail and burst into flames.".

I said "ok, what about the punk truck?"

He said "sorry, no can do the off road in that either".

He said teslas are for taking you boyfriend out for a weekend drive along the coast.

I said, "I don't go that wayliberace".

Overall, I was highly disappointed driving a Tesla for the first time.

Will be ordering a Ford F150 Hybrid with the off road package in December.

Tesla is way behind the times..!

yesterday!! TSLA is good READ: The American way. Expropriate the public some more and hand it over to your billionaire friends for more stock buybacks. Sure, why not. Bailouts for buybacks. And the plebes will still lose their jobs. The corporates and banks are the largest welfare recipients in the US. It worked!!! Just threaten to lay off thousands in order to get a bailout. Works every time. 2008 - we needed to bail out the banks, or our economy will crash! And the banks got a bailout, and billions in bonuses were being paid while our economy collapsed. We're on trillions now. Millions and billions are Chump change. It is all a game. And if you know how to play it, you can make millions and billions. Are the airline employees now the chosen ones? Can't they go on unemployment at $400 per week like the other tens of millions of unemployed Americans?.!
yesterday!! MARKETS SEE BIDEN WAYYYY AHEAD and are smiling. For now - Emerson Electric, B&G Foods, Microsoft, Mercadolibre, Alibaba, Slack Technologies (more risk but could be huge winner), GOLD/SILVER and all infrastructure plays like my Cummins, Caterpillar, Manitowoc Company, Cleveland Cliffs. With Biden we will see a switch with many more sectors moving UP especially these sleeper sectors. Also travel will be a huge winner as SUPER SPREADER TRUMP is OUT and Biden THE CURE is IN. Boolean.!

I don't know exactly the conversion, but 7.7 Lakh is about U$10,500.

Their need for $45,000 cars is tiny. Their ability to pay for $25,000 cars is very small. Their entire market is 4MM cars a year on a good year . . . for 1.4 billion people.

"Biden surges to 14-point lead over Trump after caustic first debate, poll finds" NBC Poll

Pure nonsense. The media's goal in promulgating these fraudulent polls is to provide cover for the Dems planned mail-in voter fraud. Their hope is the Dems pull off the fraud and then they can point back to the bogus polls to say "Biden was always in the lead. Just go back and look at the polls." Democrats have pushed vote by mail despite Dr. Fauci saying voting in person is safe. Democrats have also threatened violence if Trump wins. Who would vote for a party that directly threatens citizens unless they vote for them? VOTE EVERY DEMOCRAT OUT..!

"Since the outbreak began, the World Health Organization and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recommended that masks be reserved for medical workers, sick people and their caregivers — not worn by the general public."

Joe Biden's Response to Trump shutting down international travel:



"Stop the xenophobic fear-mongering. Be honest. Take responsibility. Do your job."

Biden called Trump's travel ban xenophobic so it's laughable that Democrats claim Biden would have handled this better, when in reality his attitude at the time shows a concerning lack of seriousness for the implications of an impending global pandemic.

2 days ago•Last reply 2 days ago!! Trump and all the others that have contacted COVID-19 are victims of the CCP that kept the Coronavirus quiet and allowed travelers from China to the U.S. and Europe. Trump (not being in the medical field) followed the advice from the WHO (pro Chinese) and the CDC. Trump was told it would be no worse than the flu and he passed that info on to the American public. China wants Joe Biden for president because they believe Joe will allow the CCP to continue it’s military build up that is challenging America today. Trump is pushing back on China. TRUMP SAYS BUY AMERICAN. China’s military already has more Navy ships than we do and China says it wants to double or triple the number of nuclear weapons it has. (All of this can be found on youtube). Every time we spend a USD on something made in China about half of that dollar goes to China’s military build up. The U.S. experiment toward Democratic reform in Communist Red China has failed. This is why this election is so important. You have to look at the whole picture. America’s survival depends on it.

2 days ago•Last reply 2 days ago!! Every state-run by Democratic governor's are for higher taxes and more regulations. Regulations kill business growth as a result less profits for investors like you. My own portfolio holds 50% renewable energy stocks and it is up 106% YTD. I made 10 times more money in last 4 years then entire 8 years of Obama presidency. That's why Elon Musk is moving his Tesla HQ out of Freemont, California. He already moved to Nevada and Texas. Why Elon threaten to moving his Tesla HQ out of California? Because Republican run States always favor lower taxes and less regulations which is good for his company, same time for investors as well. Remember Socialism failed in the past and it never worked. Global economy run on Capitalism. Democratic party is a Socialist Party and America will reject them again on November 3rd. Vote President Trump!.!

In other words - they spent about $1 billion and will be required to pay $ 323 million in taxes to Shangahi every year (starting in 2023) for a net 10,000 units per month.

Just to be clear the initial wave of demand for the MIC Model 3 might be sustainable or might not. The multiple price cuts suggest Tesla is seeing demand wane for the Model 3 in China..!

2 days ago•Last reply 2 days ago!! The average life of a ICE vehicle is 8 to 12 years depending on its quality, use, reliability and care. Simpler EVs, which will last much longer will dramatically change that dynamic. Every new BEV (or used) sold replaces an ICE one. Exponential growth of electric cars manufactured will exponentially overtake the fossil fueled conveyances. The nearly one and a half billion ICE cars on the road today (and their supporting infrastructure) are going to be retired much sooner than later. Because of many factors the new and used ICE cars will have less and less value. The cruise lines, hammered by the pandemic, are earlier starting to scrap more and more of their older liners. Same with the airline’s planes and big container/tanker shipping industry. They will go for pennies on the pound. The entire recycling industry will be swamped. Old ICE vehicles will soon clutter the entire planet. Investors are realizing this as TSLA’s market cap vaults..!

"Democrats, liberals, the media and others have always been wrong to simply treat him as a buffoon and a dummy and a jackass. Yes, he is all those things. But he’s also canny. He’s clever.

BMW expects FCEV to be cheaper than BEVs in 2025, Honda is aggressively working on their tech and dozens of others are in process as well. Then I read this little nugget from Germany. Nowhere near ready for production, but a 2 seater car for 15,000? Fuel cell with a small battery backup. Pretty interesting concept.

Perhaps all of that battery development (storage) will benefit fuel cells (generation), but if you have zero emissions generation at lower weight . . . what is that trade off?

That is exactly what William Li does. This gives him and his team more flexibility, lower costs and makes aggressive expansions like we are witnessing with nio possible. And I’m sure the market has already recognized that fact. I would love, if $NIO would today announce that they are building a NIO house in every greater German City, our country is small and the Germans will love $NIO. Germany, not USA, is the key to the world, because $NIO is competing directly with German car makers and study’s prove their quality and Brand is as strong as they are BY NOW, This is crazy what William Li has done and alone that Fact is worth 100$ Share price.

Remember Elon has access to some of the leading tech companies in the world Space X and Tesla, of which he is chief Engineer, he can take applications from both business and apply where they fit.

Let the future tell the truth, and evaluate each one according to his work and accomplishments. The present is theirs; the future, for which I have really worked, is mine.

3 days ago•Last reply 3 days ago!! Can anyone explain how the arcane term “deliveries” can be considered a proxy for “sales.”

We all know TSLA lumps both SALES and LEASES into the “transfer of possession” category mysteriously titled “deliveries.”

This is where TSLA’s no dealership business model falls short of the
mark. The traditional dealership takes title when the dealer takes possession, then the dealer sells or leases the car to customers. Lessees are invariably given a “buy-out provision” to purchase the car when the lease expires. TSLA has specifically rejected offering the “standard buy-out provision.” The TSLA business model calls for the hundreds of thousands of LEASE RETURNS to comprise a massive ROBO-TAXI FLEET to service a growing need for Robo-Taxi passengers———-

IMHO the TSLA business model is an enormous “bet on the come.” I don’t see a very high likelihood for success

Stay safe, be careful———.!

Very possible he'll use the opportunity to continue downplaying & encourage his supporters to go out & vote in person, & then once votes come in, suppress & prevent counting of mailed in ballots w/lawsuits across all 50 states, pushing the SCOTUS w/the new justice, to decide.

YoY sales growth (43%) - comparing Q3 2019 vs. Q3 2020
TTM sales growth (21%) - comparing Q4,Q1,Q2,Q3-2019 vs. Q4,Q1,Q2,Q3-2020
YTD sales growth (24%) - comparing Q1-Q3 2019 vs. Q1-Q3 2020

While that 43% number looks pretty good, looking at it more broadly suggests that growth is slowing . . . the two big factors include a massive influx of competitors that are ramping and significant new production capability by Tesla that will hit about the same time.

Also instructive . . . Tesla commented that they are reducing inventory, but that doesn't seem to be the case. They produced about 6,000 cars more than they sold in the quarter but they already had $1.5 billion in inventory (not all of which will be new cars).

Very interesting data when we see China's sales numbers and Germany/UK numbers for Europe (specifically looking for competition information).

6 days ago•Last reply 3 days ago!! Expect the FUD coverage of Tesla to accelerate - new tech announced at battery day represents a true existential threat to high-volume ICE manufacturers. Until now, competitors and big oil used the media (who are paid to advertise for them) to create FUD about Tesla to years. Now with Tesla scaling their proprietary battery technology you should expect utility companies begin to recognize Tesla as an existential threat through its sustainable energy capture, storage, intelligent distribution software, and microgrid solutions. Tesla is a disruptor of some of the largest sectors - commercial and consumer transport & energy. Don't fall asleep on this opportunity. You may never see another like it..!

3 days ago!! I’m surprised about the number of TSLA/Musk loyal followers. These folks have attributes considered cultish by many reasonable people in the investment community. Whereas I fully expect to see EVs to gain increasing market share, I expect that increased market share to be distributed over a vastly increased number of EV market participants, I.e., nearly all the legacy have EVs either in production or nearing the production stage.

$350 Billion market capitalization is beyond the pale for an auto manufacturer in business for 17 years and still w/out auto sales revenue.

This is a case of the company financing operations with secondary offerings of new shares ($5 billion secondary recently, and the $2 billion secondary earlier this year.)

TSLA/Musk loyalists continue to feed this unsustainable Juggernaut.....there will be a day of reckoning IMHO. At the same time I strongly advise against initiating a short sale of this vastly overvalued equity.

In house floor traders, with very, very, deep pockets view all short sellers as sitting ducks. Easy targets to force the short seller to cover at an even more inflated share price.

Be careful, we will see a correction with this behemoth.....the question is when...story stocks like TSLA can remain overvalued for longer than you would expect.!

3 days ago!! There was a good post about the recall of the Polestar 2 (all of them have to be recalled for a computer issue), and that is bad, but the (multiple) reports of Tesla's wishbone suspension failing is far more scary. Apparently the latest failure happened at 200km/h on the Autobahn.



I don't think Tesla has had a major recall since 2017. I wonder what happens if all of their suspension systems had to be replaced, without a dealer network to accommodate these failures?

Does anyone have any insight on how the company has explained how such an occurrence would be handled?

3 days ago!! Tesla spent about $1.4 billion on R&D in 2019. I would expect that number will be closer to $2 billion this year. But for those who are interested in the R&D budgets of car companies, here is a chart from Statista with the sobering reality of how that $2 billion stacks up.

.

I haven't looked for all of the data but GM spent 6.8 Billion in 2019. Toyota in 2018 spent about $10 billion. VW in 2017, spent $17 billion on R&D. So before you get too hyped up about advances being made by ANY company in the battery space, just recognize that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and a lot of companies can easily imitate Tesla now. Some will then leapfrog them. It's the nature of industry.

3 days ago•Last reply 3 days ago!! Yesterday there was an interesting post about Tesla entering the Indian market. This is exciting news to be sure.

Currently, India's average car sells for 7.7 Lakh or about 770,000 rupees. That is about 10,500 dollars. In 2019, there were approximately 3MM cars, trucks and SUVs sold in all of India.

The luxury car market is where Tesla would show up, 2019 saw the purchase of about 36,000 luxury vehicles in the entire country, for the entire year. Mercedes sells about 50% of those, BMW about 30% and VW/Audi about 20%.

Undoubtedly if Tesla were to enter the Indian car market, they would sell a lot of cars. People with high disposable incomes are often the first to switch to greener options. Let's assume they took over half of the luxury car market . . . that would be about 18,000 cars.

It's not a HUGE market when Tesla is trying to get to 1MM cars in 2022. In fact, it may just be a distraction.

Two other points to make
(1) even if Tesla were to come out with a $25,000 car, that would still be 250% more expensive than the average car in India (Suzuki has about 50% share of the entire market, and Hindustan and Tata (JLR) are also big names there.
(2) India's power grid is fraught with problems and needs massive investment, but India is renowned for their disparate and divisive politics where things just don't get done.

I hope that helps those who are thinking entry to India is going to really goose demand . . . with Tesla's production at 500,000 cars a year (average price $50,000), its not likely to be meaningful, particularly when China and the EU have very strong incentives. Wuling would be a better bet in India.

I sense a lot of frustration that the company could be down 7% (to about $450 billion market cap) after showing sales of 140,000 vehicles in the quarter.

If they continue to average $50,000/vehicle, then that is $7 billion in revenue, if they make a 2% margin, then $140MM in profit. But this quarter, the share price has risen $215 or about $260 billion in market cap.

That's just a mania . . . insane by any measure.

The drug cocktail is a combination of two so-called monoclonal antibodies. The treatment is meant to provide the body's immune system with a temporary, but immediate, boost to fight off the coronavirus.

By Corky Siemaszko
Covid-19 spread from China, but much of the "infodemic" is coming from the White House.

According to a new study from Cornell University, President Donald Trump is the world’s biggest spreader of coronavirus misinformation.

Nearly 38 percent of the “misinformation conversation” began with Trump doing things such as promoting unproven “miracle cures” for Covid-19 or claiming with zero evidence that the pandemic was a “Democratic Party hoax” aimed at derailing his presidency, the researchers from the Cornell Alliance for Science found.

Talk like that is dangerous, alliance Director Sarah Evanega said.

“We were interested in exploring this issue because the World Health Organization has identified COVID misinformation, which is dubbed an ‘infodemic,’ as a serious concern in fighting the pandemic,” she said. “If people are misled by unscientific and unsubstantiated claims about the disease, they may be less likely to observe official guidance and thus risk spreading the disease.”

In other coronavirus developments:

Cruise ships will be barred from sailing in U.S. waters for at least another month, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Nearly 3,700 confirmed or suspected cases of Covid-19 on cruise ships in the United States have been reported to the CDC since March 1 and at least 41 people died, the agency said.
Around 837,000 people filed for first-time jobless benefits last week as the pandemic-battered U.S. economy continued to struggle. The unemployment rate was 4.8 percent when Trump took office in January 2017. It’s 8.4 percent now.
Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves announced he would not extend his mask-wearing mandate even though his state has the fourth-highest rate of new infections in the country with 17.8 percent, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Research Center. "We should not use the heavy hand of government more than it is justified," Reeves said.
Hospitals in the parts of Wisconsin where the number of coronavirus cases have recently spiked are running out of beds for patients. In Green Bay, where Trump on Saturday is supposed to hold a campaign rally, Bellin Hospital was reportedly already at 94 percent capacity. Wisconsin right now is the state with the third-highest rate of new infections with 21.14 percent, according to Johns Hopkins.
White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said Trump has no plan to cancel the Green Bay rally, even though Wisconsin's governor has urged the president to reconsider. "Yeah, so the president believes that people have a first amendment right to political speech," McEnany said. "He is having a rally. People can choose whether or not to come.
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican who has gotten bipartisan praise for aggressively attacking the pandemic, reported that for the first time in 187 days the state recorded "zero new Covid-19 deaths."
A Pennsylvania federal appeals court said Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, can resume enforcing size limits on gatherings while it appeals an earlier lower court ruling by a Trump-appointed federal judge who threw out statewide crowd size limits and other measures aimed at stopping the virus from spreading.
New York, which was once the nation's hot spot, reported more than 1,300 new cases on Thursday. That is the most since May. While the state continues to maintain a less than two percent infection rate, clusters of new Covid-19 cases have been reported in Brooklyn, Queens and Rockland County. People in New York City who refuse to don masks could be hit with fines of up to $1,000.
The Cornell study, released Thursday, appears to be the first comprehensive look at pandemic misinformation in the media, and the researchers reached their conclusions after using a content aggregator to analyze 38 million Covid-19 articles from English-language news outlets around the world.

They found that Trump drove major misinformation ”spikes” when he talked about using bleach to cure Covid-19 or when he advocated unproven treatments like hydroxychloroquine.

Trump’s false claim about the pandemic being created by the "deep state" to install a “new world order” was also a big driver of misinformation. So was the president’s promotion of conspiracy theories that Covid-19 was a bio-weapon that was “intentionally or accidentally released by a laboratory in Wuhan, China.”

Much of Trump's false Covid-19 information was dispensed at his coronavirus press briefings, which he ditched in April after his advisers warned the.!

“When one great power threatens to displace another, war is almost always the result.” As China challenges America’s superpower status and predominance that could lead them into a deadly trap first identified by the ancient Greek historian Thucydides. As he explained, “It was the rise of Athens and the fear that this instilled in Sparta that made war inevitable.” The past 500 years have seen 16 cases in which a rising power threatened to displace a ruling one. Twelve of these ended in war. We are now one of those time in history..!

Before you foolishly consider reckless destruction of your portfolio by buying this stock read Benjamin Grahams books which Warren Buffet calls the most important books he has and his favorites.

Warren Buffet said that Benjamin Graham is the reason for his success and his books he read before signing up to be his student.
Read "Security Analysis" and "Intelligent Investor" and after you do you won't ever again want to buy a stock like Tesla.

Sure, like a Siren it calls to you to wreck your boat on the rocks, but a wise person listens not and will watch
at the inevitable collapse of this insanely overpriced balloon stock.

4 days ago•Last reply 4 days ago!! Vale (NYSE:VALE) +2.6% after-hours following a Reuters report that it is in talks with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and others in the electric vehicle supply chain about securing nickel from its Canadian operations.
Tesla and other automakers need to ensure there is sufficient nickel available to produce the number of batteries required for EVs over the next 5-8 years, Mark Travers, Vale's executive director of base metals, tells Reuters.
Asked whether Vale and Tesla have held discussions, Travers said: "Yes, absolutely."
Vale is expanding its Voisey's Bay site in Labrador to an underground operation that will produce ~40K metric tons/year of nickel-in-concentrate.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk in July urged miners to produce more nickel, promising to offer a "giant contract" if supplies could be produced in an environmentally sensitive way..!

4 days ago•Last reply 4 days ago!! “Lithium is the new oil”, Víctor Manuel Toledo, Mexico’s Environment Secretary said on announcing the Sonora discovery. However, Sonora may not be the answer long-term -- it is fraught with environmental impacts from water extraction and tailings. Thacker Pass may be the preferred and more environmentally conscious long term choice for OEMs producing EVs.
BMO said it could be several years, if ever, before $TSLA gets its extraction tech to work -- Tesla still needs a dependable supply of lithium. $LAC could fulfill that need over the next decade, given they should be the #3 producer in the world by the mid 2020s. Could Elon be buying up shares today to exercise some control of the company? Insiders control a large percentage -- it is great when retail can get in before institutions. Do not forget Tesla is far from being the only EV player. $NIO and other OEMs should be on top of this too..!

"I know that me claiming Tesla being (absurdly) overvalued and that the stock is a gigantic bubble will lead to a lot of headwind and controversy and people telling me that I also don't get it (like all these other old school investors). Be that as it may, Tesla is a textbook example of a bubble. We don't even have to know what Tesla does or how it makes money.Tesla in September 2020. How do you justify a 1,000% increase within 12 months? What happened? What changed? I know the reasons, which are usually brought forward. When having a P/E ratio above 1,000 (taking the trailing 12 months earnings per share) and a price/sales ratio above 15, almost nobody is arguing with fundamental aspects anymore. I can't even imagine what has to happen for a large cap company to justify such increases. It is often claimed that people are just waking up and are finally understanding Tesla. Really? Millions of investors and thousands of analysts took several years to understand Tesla. And they were not just wrong a little bit about the true value of the company, the true value of the stock is more than ten times higher as analysts previously estimated?"".!

When I buy a product and the company slaps me in the face and tells me they won't deliver it for 6 months, a year, maybe two years, I'd be pretty angry and cancel. Tesla fanboys not only thank the company for their pathetic turnaround, but are wildly impressed that they had so many back logged deliveries during a pandemic. How many new sales were booked for Q3 though? Nah don't worry about it..!

26 days ago•Last reply 4 days ago!! TSLA already have a market cap bigger than Toyota. Toyota ships 11 mil cars a year, Tesla doesn't even ship half a million. It will take 5-10 years for Tesla to ramp up to that level. So Tesla stock is priced in for at least 6 years of growth. Then what is the point of pumping it even higher? I don't understand. It's an amazing story, but no amount of innovation can justify current valuation and more importantly farther increase in SP..!

It's possible after the scientific polls came out showing he lost the debate, his campaign concocted a fake COVID-19 to ensure Trump can claim it's harmless and for all his supporters to go out and vote.

I don't think there is much room remain for all high flyer to continue as valuation which was 10x earning 2018 now gone to 50 time and so on. Even tesla which is car company with <10% gross margin trading at 20 time revenue and hardly any moat in market.

Their product demand isn't great and Elon forced to lower prices lately to keep demand. There is still good demand but it's at risk to go out of balance very fast and very quickly..!

4 days ago•Last reply 4 days ago!! The ratings by the EU are actually inaccurate. They claim that the Tesla name of auto-pilot can be misleading - well, depends on if you are intelligent or not. Further, their claim that the Tesla Model 3 auto pilot completely disengages when the driver takes over - THAT'S WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO. Would you really want your cruise control to NOT disengage when you hit the brake? When the driver wrests control of the steering wheel from the system, it absolutely does what it is supposed to do. GIVE CONTROL TO THE DRIVER.

The rating was unfair and quickly exposes their bias.
Disclaimer: I've driven the Tesla Model 3 and found it to be exactly as expected.
As a software engineer - the system does precisely what it is supposed to do.

4 days ago!! Honda to stop racing F1 to focus on zero emission vehicles . . . hmmm. Buried in this Reuters story is Honda plans for 2/3 of their vehicle deliveries to be 'new energy vehicles' by 2030 (that would be 3.5MM vehicles) and Toyota is expecting their electric vehicle deliveries to reach 5.5MM in 2025.

VW is also expecting a few million by then.

To frame this effectively, Tesla may (MAY) have the capacity to build 2, perhaps 3MM vehicles by 2025. Likely 5 or perhaps 6 models.

I can't tell you how it will all work out, but I can tell you that competition is coming.

We know they have 25K capacity for Model X/S and demand only 15K so they loss 10K capacity ideal there.

That come to Model 3 /Y demand /supply question. Most important as it's cheapest model.
China capacity is 200K/year =50k 3 month ago and was expanding still. But let's say it's still same.
USA Capacity: 400K/year =100K

Total capacity is 175K and they produced 145K , 10 K clearly due to lower demand for model S and X which expected by all.
But 20K for lower demand for Model 3/Y even if we say they loss 5% capacity for any reason we talking 10K lower demand still..!

If Tesla can keep up this pace it’s easy to see where the stock will be in a year or two. New plant in China, building in Berlin and Austin Texas will help them increase production to 2 million in a couple of years. Increases are starting to become exponential and soon the losses and set backs at legacy companies will be exponential. The power of disruption!.!

4 days ago!! bold.!
4 days ago•Last reply 4 days ago!! Given the numbers that Tesla reported, this should be down by 50%, so it is actually holding up well. Here is why I think it should be down much more. Record production at Fremont was about 105k in 4Q2019. With two factories, record production is now 145k. If we assume that Fremont was still able to produce 105k, then Shanghai only produced 40k in the quarter, which is just over 3k per week. That would mean that the maximum production capacity of Shanghai is 160k per year, not the 200k that Tesla has claimed. It also means that Tesla's overall capacity is less than 600k per year with two factories. Musk said, back in 2017, that investors should have zero doubt that they would be able to produce 10k Model 3s per week by the end of 2018. Not only was that not true, but it is still not true. Tesla was able to make 128k this quarter, but with two factories and including the Model Ys. Now in order to hit 500k, Tesla will need to deliver just over 180k in 4Q2020. Is that possible? The simple answer is no. They cannot produce that many vehicles, so they cannot deliver that many.

Musk also said that new vehicle inventory was declining. So let's look at the numbers. Total production from 1Q2018 to 2Q2020 was 804724 and total deliveries in that period was 791170. That is a difference of 13554. Now we know that Tesla just added about 6k to that total, raising it to almost 20k. That is 20k more cars that were made than were sold. Tesla stopped reporting in transit numbers more than a year ago. I suspect that was so that they could include those in their delivery numbers. But giving them the benefit of the doubt, let's say they do not. In the past, the in transit numbers have been as high as 10k. So for Musk's statement to be true, they would need more than 6k in transit at the moment, which is actually reasonable. But unless they are able to make 160k vehicles this quarter and sell every single car in inventory, it will be impossible for Tesla to reach 500k deliveries. 500k in a year. Other automakers that are valued five to ten times lower than Tesla can do that in less than a month. Biggest bubble ever..!

The 3 dark triad traits, along with a president who can't feel empathy for the suffering of others and dead Americans and was instead more interested in staying in power so he won't get indicted after office, ensured that almost a quarter of Americans are now dead. And that number's still increasing. In fact, the infection rates are starting to go up again, with red states, where people trust lies coming from Trump, leading almost 3 to 1 vs blue states. Deaths WILL follow.

3TWH from about 50 GWH (2019) is a 60X in battery manufacturing in next 10 years

"Ford (F) reported a 5% drop in in Q3 U.S. auto sales, outperforming 10% declines at both General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU)."...

"Meanwhile, Tesla (TSLA) reported Q3 deliveries of 139,300 vehicles, a new record high that topped analysts' downgraded estimates of 137,000."

So GM performed worse than Ford and yet GM is up 1.6% and Tesla is sown 5%, ha ha ha..!

If on the other hand, if Trump loses the capacity to be the president any more, it means the beginning of ending the chaos in this great country, stock performance will be even better.

4 days ago!! TSLA is likely to crash hard before it makes new gains anywhere close to the last year.

There is little room for a justified - thus lasting - upside in the next few months and even years. On the other hand, even if there were no bad news specific to Tesla in that time, such a volatile and overpriced stock is due to fall badly should the market as a whole retreat.

And there are still plenty of risks today that could cause a general crash, from COVID to the election to international tensions, on top of older issues as ever increasing inequality and a stock market that's becoming ever mode speculative and unstable which may call for further regulation.

Mid term, let's say up to 2 or 3 years, I don't think Tesla is at all a safe place to store money. Best to take the eventual gains and eventually wait for a better entry point, a significantly lower one. IMHO of course..!

2020 will be a boom year:
1) They entered in the HAND SANITIZERS sector with huge margins;
2) ELECTRIC CARS requires dense biofuel to produce electricity in high volumes on board!

I guess that AMTX and PEIX are the perfect fits to do partnership with electric cars producers like Tesla, Nikola,...

For example, Nissan e-bio van uses 8 gallon ethanol tanks to fuel hydrogen fuel cell to provide 400 mile range

- High power, long range electric vehicles requires energy dense, storable, transportable fuel.

ELECTRIC CARS will need ethanol fuel cells for power and range!

$amtx $peix $gpre $tsla $nkla

STRONG BUY!
AMTX and PEIX will hopefully reach double digit soon!.!

Piper Sandler expects Tesla's energy business to reach more than $200 billion per year in revenue.

“We anticipate sharply higher demand for these products, particularly in the late 2020s and 2030s as renewable energy grows toward 40% of electricity generation,” the analyst said.

Tesla Energy represented $1.5 billion in revenue for the company in fiscal 2019.

In fiscal 2023, the analyst projects that Tesla Energy will hit $12.4 billion in revenue — and cross $200 billion by 2033.

Tesla will control over one-third of the market for stationary batteries, he said, adding that Tesla management has previously stated that the segment will generate as much as Tesla's automotive operations..!

4 days ago!! PALO ALTO, Calif., Oct. 02, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In the third quarter, we produced just over 145,000 vehicles and delivered nearly 140,000 vehicles.

Production Deliveries Subject to operating lease accounting
Model S/X 16,992 15,200 13%
Model 3/Y 128,044 124,100 7%
Total 145,036 139,300 7%
In terms of days of sales, new vehicle inventory declined further in Q3 as we continue to improve our delivery efficiency.

Our net income and cash flow results will be announced along with the rest of our financial performance when we announce Q3 earnings. Our delivery count should be viewed as slightly conservative, as we only count a car as delivered if it is transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct. Final numbers could vary by up to 0.5% or more. Tesla vehicle deliveries represent only one measure of the company’s financial performance and should not be relied on as an indicator of quarterly financial results, which depend on a variety of factors, including the cost of sales, foreign exchange movements and mix of directly leased vehicles..!

They do start with very large inventory and so while demand still better than supply, it much closer to balance and very soon can go downward. When balance, they have to spend signficant on promotion and when downward they are just typical other automaker where cost per car increase while sale per price decrease and also forced to sell though dealership.

I thought it might happen in 2021 late half but given soft china demand after only 6 month of factory and how much inventory left unsold telling me that This might start around April /May next year.

Be careful, Producing car is one thing , selling is entirely different..!

$TSLA conversation
TSLA will rise up to 470 and then could fall back to about 420 by October 9th before going back up to 505 - 510 on or about 15th October. Just my analysis based on what I have observed since TSLA started trading..!
4 days ago!! Someone decided to mock the Sweden and Norway data. You shouldn't. Sales are down pretty dramatically in these two (tiny) countries.

The data suggests that when the big boys come out to play that Tesla's sales decline, in these markets at least. The question is will it continue as the competition expands in the rest of the world.

In Sweden
- M/M Sales are up 1058 vs. 1002 or +5.5% for September
- Q/Q Sales are down 1902 vs. 1307 or -31% for Q3
- YTD Sales are down 3686 vs. 4848 or -24% for 9 months

Norway saw a dramatic drop however. 1439 vs. 2762 or down 48%
- M/M Sales are down 1439 vs. 2762 or - 48% for September
- Q/Q Sales are down 1821 vs. 4084 or - 56% for Q3
- YTD Sales are down 3903 vs. 16,609 or -77% for 9 months

You can be a blind optimist, but that doesn't change the data. These two tiny countries may not be representative, but they are 'mature' markets for EVs and so may represent the future.

When Germany and UK are announced they will provide a lot more insight as they are much larger markets.

Who will win the battle to save the lives of babies or preserve what God says in the Bible is a marriage between a man and a woman? The Republicans are on Gods side. The Democrats are supporting alternative marriage and abortion. Trump recently gave an order saving the lives of babies AFTER BIRTH. They can no longer be killed.

4 days ago•Last reply 4 days ago!! Tesla will have zero sales in China by 2030: analyst
Daniel HowleyTechnology Editor
,Yahoo Finance•October 1, 2020

Tesla (TSLA) may not have much of a future in the world’s largest electric vehicle market, if one analyst’s predictions pan out. Morgan Stanley’s (MS) Adam Jonas says that CEO Elon Musk’s high-tech automotive company will likely see sales in China plummet to zero by 2030.

“We have China sales peaking [in the] middle of the decade and then going down...and then eventually nothing after 2030,” Jonas told Yahoo Finance’s “On the Move” this week.

China has become an important market for Tesla, since Musk worked with the country’s government to build out the firm’s Shanghai Gigafactory. The country has the fastest growing EV market in the world, but saw sales dip last year as Beijing began to phase out government subsidies for alternative energy vehicles with the expectation of ending them in 2020.

Tesla, which doubled its sales in China in the first half of 2020, controls 21% of that country’s EV market, Nikkei Asia reported in August, citing Chinese research firm Ways. That was up from 6% the year prior. But it also comes as Chinese EV sales tumbled by roughly half, according to the report.

In March, the country extended those subsidies, and in April decided that the subsidies would run until 2022 in an effort to prop up sales of EVs and reach a self-imposed goal of alternative energy vehicles accounting for a fifth of all vehicles sales by 2025.

So why then does Jonas believe Tesla’s sales in China will fall off a cliff by 2030? It all has to do with the company’s hopes for autonomous vehicle systems and the impact of the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China.

With data privacy and security between U.S. and Chinese tech companies top of mind, Jonas said, it’s unlikely the U.S. would allow a network of Chinese-made autonomous vehicles to drive around any major U.S. city in the future. Naturally, the flip side would also be true.

“Can you imagine a Chinese internet of cars autonomous network operating in the streets of Boston in 10 years? Of course not. Wake up. It's not happening,” he said.

“And so this idea that the Chinese aren't allowed to use AI network machine learning data privacy networks from the state, but it's okay for us to do [it] there, is just a fallacy in our opinion,” Jonas added.

While Jonas noted that Tesla might be able to own a stake in an EV Chinese entity, he said that there are still too many unknowns when it comes to how much Chinese and U.S. companies will be allowed to interface with each others’ countries in the future.

Tesla’s stock has been on a tear in 2020, with retail investors largely seen as a major catalyst for its rise from $93.81 at the start of the year to $448.16 as of the close of markets on Oct. 1.

Recently, the company hosted its annual Battery Day event, where Musk announced plans for a new vehicle with a starting price of $25,000 that will be available in three years, something he’s promised in the past. That would be a significant price drop from the current Model 3, which starts at $37,990 before incentives. The company also discussed plans to mine its own lithium..!

In terms of days of sales, new vehicle inventory declined further in Q3 as we continue to improve our delivery efficiency.
Our net income and cash flow results will be announced along with the rest of our financial performance when we announce Q3 earnings. Our delivery count should be viewed as slightly conservative, as we only count a car as delivered if it is transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct. Final numbers could vary by up to 0.5% or more. Tesla vehicle deliveries represent only one measure of the company’s financial performance and should not be relied on as an indicator of quarterly financial results, which depend on a variety of factors, including the cost of sales, foreign exchange movements and mix of directly leased vehicles..!

In terms of days of sales, new vehicle inventory declined further in Q3 as we continue to improve our delivery efficiency.
Our net income and cash flow results will be announced along with the rest of our financial performance when we announce Q3 earnings. Our delivery count should be viewed as slightly conservative, as we only count a car as delivered if it is transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct. Final numbers could vary by up to 0.5% or more. Tesla vehicle deliveries represent only one measure of the company’s financial performance and should not be relied on as an indicator of quarterly financial results, which depend on a variety of factors, including the cost of sales, foreign exchange movements and mix of directly leased vehicles..!

17 days ago•Last reply 4 days ago!! Battery day share price Target. Most institutional trading on TSLA will wrap monday afternoon not tuesday or once their PT has been reached (assuming it is reached). If we move to a higher stock price the Institutional market will be skittish and sell some. The question is how late are the robin hooders going to buy into next week ? are they going to be goated into investing in TSLA or will they fall prey to the Shorts #$%$D. ? IF the stock is above $500 tuesday morning could go either way (keep in mind that TSLA's PE is over 1000 and all that is needed is the slightest doubt and the stock will slip $50-$100 just like that !, But if the stock is below $450 tuesday morning (opening at approximately 4:00am) It will most likely climb into the battery day presentation (about 2-2:30pm ... which takes place just after after the general shareholders meeting)..!

This is far more important: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-clear-path-first-german-040000354.html you see, a relentless focus on clearly defined objectives is what makes TESLA so successful compared to the legacy car makers --- When times get tough, Elon sleeps on the factory floor, when traditional OEMs go on holiday, Elon "works like hell", when the rest put on the brakes because they see a crash coming, Elon hits the accelerator. That, my fellow longs, is how you win..!

4 days ago•Last reply 4 days ago!! Trump is on Gods side if you read the Bible. The Democratic Party has gone against Gods word embracing abortion and a redefinition of what God says in the Bible is marriage. Between a man and a woman. Trump is not perfect (Only God is) and God has used imperfect people in the Bible to fore fill his will. BUT Trump has embraced Gods word and he has put God in front of everything while the Democrats want to hide God from public view. Religious freedom will be under attack if the Democrats win.

Let's pray to to help us focus on the moment while at the same time knowing we cannot capture that moment, we are in a flow of moments we let flow. We can watch moments in detail without being attached to them. Non-attachment to past & future stems from this practice. Worry about past or future is wasted energy, however we can observe the past & learn from it without agonising over it & trust ourselves to handle the future better. We can celebrate the opportunity to grow as we gain understanding from observation & experience. We can watch ourselves & avoid being caught up in over-reactions. Let's pray for a swift recovery of our POTUS & FLOTUS!!.!

It takes up to seven days for symptoms to manifest if you're not asymptomatic, so there is not one person in there right mind who will be willing to hold positions over the weekend in case he gets really sick. Even worse, the white house is refusing to tell anyone if he has symptoms or not, so you know he does, otherwise they'd be out there bragging, "see, it's no worse than the flu!". He's got symptoms and there's no treatment. NOBODY HOLDS A POSITION OVER THE WEEKEND. NOBODY. IT'S GOING TO BE A BLOODBATH..!

4 days ago!! Really, once Tesla can mass produce a $25000 fully autonomious and reasonably practical car, with a range of 500 + miles, while would you buy another car unless you have special needs ( probably less than 30% of car owners)?
And when Elon says, thats just 3 years away, we give it an additional year.

So at most 5 years from now, not only Tesla has the capacicty to produce more than 2 millions vehicles/year(they have fully optimised their manufacturing and added more factories in more locations) but they will also be able to reinvest and build more Gigafactories around the world and meet a good chunk of new cars demand. 5 years is what i think it will take to propel $Tsla beyond $4000 whiteout ever looking back..!
4 days ago!! $460 today :)?.!
4 days ago!! What Tesla really needs to do to re-ignite its growth engine is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for Tesla (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if Tesla just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.

Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon. Read our last analysis and you’ll see..!

5 days ago•Last reply 5 days ago!! Here is the story: The main OEM companies like $F, $GM, and Do we still have Dodge and Chrysler? The last 10 years I only focused on MB, BMW X5, Lexus.
I have never thought of any American made cars like GM or F...which stands for "Grabage cars and Makers". Outside of US, Korea, Japan, and maybe in China...only the poor people drive Ford or GM vehicles.
Anyway, the mainstream medias get paid by the OLD boys of vehicle and they spend so much money to bring down EV sectors wanting and willing to see them crumble becasue 1. old OEMs still think that ICE will never be replaced. 2. The BODs don't and did not care for the future because they only care about their current salary. 3. They soon know that if they do not topple Tesla, they will be out of business soon.....so they pay mainstream media to "talk bad about EV market callling it the Bubble...it will never work....etc. BUT we all know the days are coming and is here for the Tesla and $nio will dominate the motor world moving forward while ICE Corp the old money will be extinct soon. So forget about the dumb article and interviews...they all are getting paid by the Motor City..!

5 days ago•Last reply 5 days ago!! Democratic party wants to keep minorities ( especially Black and Hispanic) living poor and always stay in food stamps!! If you look at the Department of social and health services (welfare dept) website, they have law created as ” If you are a full time or half time student in college or university - you must work 20hrs minimum per week ( 80 hrs/month) in order to be eligible for food stamp which is very hard for a student to work at the same time pursue a degree. On the other hand if you don't work and not a student then you can get food benefits. Democrats made this kind of law to keep minorities not to work and stay in generational poverty!! If you don't believe me then look at the law yourself in Google or call your local welfare office. Ask them ” I am a student and I don't work due to study time, am I eligible for food stamps”. Their answer would be ”NO”.!

Besides they say he has paid millions in Federal taxes. And remember...Trump donates his salary to charity or he returns it to the Treasury. Try to name a past president that did that!.!

(WWJ) A pair of nationally-known conservative activists have been charged in a robocall scam aimed at suppressing the vote in the November general election.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has charged Jacob Wohl, of California, and Jack Burkman, of Virgina, with four felonies in connection with the calls that went out in late August, to around 12,000 voters in Detroit.

They warned residents that voting absentee would allow them to be targeted by police, credit card companies and even health departments for mandatory vaccines.

Wohl and Burkman have been behind a series of recent hoaxes, according to authorities, including paying actors to dupe the Washington Post into reporting that there was an FBI raid on Wohl's home, and paying a man to accuse Democratic Presidential Candidate Pete Buttagiej of sexual assault.

Nessel said Wohl and Burkman had the gall to use their own names on the robocalls, targeting urban voters.

"I honestly think that they've gotten away with so many things for so long, they thought that no one would do anything, and they thought it wouldn't matter," Nessel told WWJ's Sandra McNeill. "Why not advertise who's out there trying to interfere with people's right to vote?"

Burkman, 54, and Wohl, 22, are each charged with:

• One count of election law – intimidating voters, a five-year felony;
• One count of conspiracy to commit an election law violation, a five-year felony;
• One count of using a computer to commit the crime of election law – intimidating voters, a seven-year felony; and
• Using a computer to commit the crime of conspiracy, a seven-year felony.

The charges were filed Thursday n the 36th District Court in Detroit.

Arraignments are pending for both defendants.

“Any effort to interfere with, intimidate or intentionally mislead Michigan voters will be met with swift and severe consequences,” Nessel said. “This effort specifically targeted minority voters in an attempt to deter them from voting in the November election. We’re all well aware of the frustrations caused by the millions of nuisance robocalls flooding our cell phones and landlines each day, but this particular message poses grave consequences for our democracy and the principles upon which it was built. Michigan voters are entitled to a full, free and fair election in November and my office will not hesitate to pursue those who jeopardize that.”

The Attorney General encourages anyone in Michigan who received this call on or about Aug. 26 to contact her office by calling 517-335-7650..!

High quality competition is forcing them to cut tesla prices in China. And there is plenty of competition.
Nobody who is riding the wave cuts prices even once, never mind 3 times in one year. Just ask Apple.

Tesla appears to be hurting for sales growth in China. They have no choice but to cut prices and let the bottom line (that is "profit" for you Robinhooders) drop precipitously..!

Indeed, it has only managed four profitable quarters in its entire existence, surviving on revenue from California’s EV credit scheme and oceans of debt. So it is perhaps not surprising to see Tesla on the hunt for more government subsidies to keep it afloat. However many people, having grown accustom to headlines about GMs solid vehicle sales in recent years, may not realize that they too are not paying any federal corporate taxes..!

Let me tell you something, if it wasn't for TSLA, the trajectory of the world would be much the same as it had been in the 2000's, with oil companies and other dirty industries dominating the world and raining havoc to both mankind and environment everywhere. TSLA changed the status quo. Who would have thought the mammoth oil companies would become such losers, and their overbearing influence all but gone. A decade ago, big oil had all the dollars and everyone wanted to invest in it. Today, a beautiful green and peaceful world gets all the money, and everyone wants to invest in it. So, you're asking me, does the company that brought us to this day and intends to bring us to a much brighter future deserve a $450 billion market cap? I say, you betcha it deserves it and much much more..!

Also, to bring manufacturing to the markets (Shanghai and Berlin) that are most promising in the EV sphere. In addition to that he mentioned that Tesla will come out with a US$25,000 fully independent EV car for the wider market. Progressive thinking and a listening ear by the company CEO will translate into higher revenues and higher stock price in the future. I will go loooooooooong on this one..!

Some even showing the normal wear and tear of any car after a few years. The Super Charging stations are busy, destination chargers at hotels, motels and shopping malls were mostly full. Tesla and production deliveries are ramping up. Teslas will be soon be ubiquitous across the nation and overseas. 7 out of 10 houses on my block have solar. This high growth will continue. Of course, California has 2nd the highest gas prices after Hawaii but the other states’ gas prices are steadily climbing. Long TSLA share holders are getting rich. It won’t matter who the President is. It’ll be good if the competition steps and does it’s part for sustainable energy. Elon Musk’s vision is now a reality..!

TSLA is futuristic world's leader in so many innovations and technology that will change our way of life and the lives of many future generations to come. Hold TSLA long minimum of 7 years that's how you'll increase your wealth significantly. people who trade TSLA and are in and out are losers, as they can't time TSLA"S dynamics and the many events and news that a growth company like TSLA have. people who short TSLA are the biggest losers as TSLA may have red days here and there but the TSLA trend is up and will continue for at least next 10 years. TSLA just started to grow and progress, its growth potential is the best growth story in the market. Don't listen to any Naysayers..Stay the course hold TSLA long. I think TSLA'S stock price can possibly reach $700 to $800 by year end. TSLA will experience few splits and continue the trend up as the company continues to grow and innovate..!

These ”analysts” when learning something good is taking place at a company and yet some traders of their firm maybe shorting the stock, they will download the stock for those stupid traders to get out or even reverse position from short to long. You can trust them, better yet trade against their advice..!

5 days ago•Last reply 5 days ago!! Tesla Sales Data corrected:

Thanks to those (who politely) pointed out my bad sales data for Tesla Q3. I had a very clear error in my monthly table for China sales. This data is based on SEC filings, not monthly sales figures:

Q3 - 2019 - 97,186 delivered
Q3 - 2020 - 140-145,000 estimated.

That would be about 45% growth. Much better than my estimated 20% decline.

Guru..!
5 days ago•Last reply 5 days ago!! anything over 140k is good tomorrow. 150k+ would be insane..!
5 days ago•Last reply 5 days ago!! Lets say by 2030, Tesla achieves 20 million cars sold a year (Elon's Estimate). That is currently 2019 Toyota's and Volkswagen's sales combined.... Tesla's market cap TODAY is already higher than both companies combined. But but what about the battery technology? 1) Its not Tesla's battery tech its actually a partnership with CATL ( a Chinese company look it up) 2) Making their own battery is the only way they could lower prices to 25k and thus able to sell 20 million. So the best case scenario by 2030 is already priced in, that's why the 1100+ P/E..!

5 days ago•Last reply 5 days ago!! Tsla was able to slash price of Model 3 in China because it's battery supplier in China, CATL, developed the cobalt free battery at $80/kWh. However CATL supply to many manufacturers in China and around the world. Btw, CATL also has the 1.24 million miles battery available to anyone.

5 days ago!! "Race to the bottom dollar

The new price of the Shanghai-made Model 3 Standard Range Plus represents an 8% discount to the previously listed price of 271,550 yuan, or about $40,000. Tesla factors in Chinese government subsidies for electric vehicles (EVs) when it calculates the base price.

In the U.S., the base price for the Model 3 Standard Range Plus is $37,990, making the Chinese Model 3 slightly cheaper than the U.S. version. That's largely due to superior government incentives. U.S. federal tax credits for Tesla's EVs were phased out at the beginning of this year. However, Tesla's website claims that "potential incentives" could reduce the U.S. price even further."

Tesla referring to incentives coming under Joe Biden's $2 Trillion Green Plan for America (and Made in America).

Markets are starting to price in a Biden win. EV, solar stocks advancing.

Apparently, coal mining investment is not the way to go..!

6 days ago•Last reply 5 days ago!! $NKLA will never be $TSLA. $NIO $BYDDF and $XPEV will likely be more suited to reach over $50b valuation. $LI has more leverage over NKLA. Everyone in this cohort produce and manufacture except NKLA. Tesla has tech, battery, software and you name it. Nio has battery swap and upgrading their autopilot feature plug upgrading their manufacturikg facility. BYD is a battery company and created the blade battery for greater range performance. They sell many commercial electric vehicles and in the battery business. Xpeng may be a copycat of Tesla but they are a brand with products selling in both China and Europe. Li may be hybrid but at least they do manufacture their own vehicles and sell. Nikola is hoping to have GM because they have nothing. In the end, Nikola will be the next Tilray and they will bring GM down with them. ✌.!

That's because leftist lunatic governors and mayors are intent on keeping everyone locked down to create maximum damage to the economy until they try to steal the election with fraudulent "mail-in voting". Then it will all magically go away. The "infection rates" and "death rate" will all inexplicably fall while the leftist regime schemes to install their Marxist agenda. Identity politics, reparations, defund the police, unbridled immigration, anti-religion, anti-Americanism, pro-globalism, pro-corruption. Yes, China Joe is well versed in giving away our jobs to China, keeping the military industrial complex happy and healthy with fraudulent wars, all while enriching himself and his family. He and his cabal will be safe and sound behind their walls of protection. You and I? Not so much..!

(excerpt from Teslerati article by Dacia J. Ferris)

"The decision to use a Tesla Model 3 as an official patrol vehicle for Bargersville Police Department in Indiana has proven to be a financial boon over the last 13 months it’s been in use. In a matchup against a Dodge Charger in their inventory, the all-electric sedan cost $6755 less in “fuel” and maintenance from August 2019 to August 2020. The Model 3’s performance and reliability overall has also been positive, and another Tesla may be added to the fleet next year as a result.

Todd Bertram, an officer with the Bargersville PD who has publicly discussed the department’s decision to purchase the Model 3 in recent months, posted the comparison data on his official Twitter account this week. As shown, the Dodge Charger ended up with maintenance and gas costs of $7580 while the Model 3 maintenance and electricity costs totaled $825 for the same time period.".!

1. Iron phosphate based battery is much cheaper and safer for both cars and storage. Chinese BYD is selling well with its newly developed iron phosphate based battery.
most storage will use iron phosphate since its cheap and safe and weight does not mater to its applications.

2. KCAC is developing battery with VW thats is much better than what Tesla has announced on its battery day.

3. any significant price upward movement in LI, Co, Ni will have huge impact on its profit. Tesla has no long term control of those metal price.

4. there are many companies who are developing better batteries including LG Chem, Panosonic,
CATL, Tesla has little competitve advantages in battery technology compared to existing battery manufacturing.

However many people, having grown accustom to headlines about GMs solid vehicle sales in recent years, may not realize that they too are not paying any federal corporate taxes..!

Stock prices do not seem to be based on quantifiable metrics but rather priced to affect the group that is most vulnerable to exploitation (bears vs bulls). I mean how can Tesla Really be worth more than Toyota? Interest rates are almost 0 which means money does not even earn interest....it has to be "invested" in something to appreciate. The Fed and other central banks print trillions in vapor dollars whenever they think they need to while commodities, fuel, food, and wages don't appreciate at the rate of "in favor" equities... so it seems like things are at a critical juncture of what the meaning of money actually is..!

That along with another 7 billion raised earlier will make it 12 billion this year alone. Also remember Tesla's goal of 25k cars will come at a cost of reducing margins to near zero. In a sense Tesla is taking your bullish stock money to give back to society. While this is a great cause, I feel like most people in this chat misunderstand Tesla's mission. Its not "great products great profits", its "were gonna dedicate all our resource ( your money ) for green emissions.".!

10 days ago•Last reply 6 days ago!! So gas car companies can’t catch up to Tesla, but can other EV can? The answer is NO because it took Tesla several versions to mass produce a vehicle model 3 but it took a model y to iron out the bugs so that was a 10 year lifespan, maybe even more. So all these EV companies can talk about their latest technology and how they are going to beat TESLA but without a consumer ready product this is all talk and promises. Tesla wins.!

I'll bet they don't use recyclable grocery bags, or conserve water, electricity, plastics, glass, even simple things like just driving a few less wasted trips.

I'm tired of being lectured by the "righteous", when my "house" is in much better order, than most whom lecture.

So, I buy stocks to make a profit, not to BRAG to the rest of the world of how I am fixing everything, and they are not..!

6 days ago•Last reply 6 days ago!! The Bureau of Labor Statistics has been tracking the Taxi industry for a long time. There are only about 75,000 active taxi drivers in the US, and less than 200,000 drivers in the ground transportation business. They make about $25,000 per year (median). Cab drivers probably don't cover their car costs.

Now Uber has about 900,000 drivers, they reportedly average $3.75/hour, so in a 2000 hour year, that's about $7,500 (let's call it $20,000 a year for the serious drivers). Uber drivers probably cover their car costs (above the $3.75/hour).

So we have about 1 million drivers, in total, in the entire USA.

1. How do bulls (and Tesla) think they are going to get 1 MM automated cars (in the near term at least?).
2. If the drivers are making $3.75 an hour, what do you think the profit is going to look like when 2 or 3,000 unmanned cars start driving around a major city? (The margins will drop like a rock).

Of course people may all of a sudden be really excited about getting into a car with no driver and paying MORE than when they have a driver, but that isn't likely to happen overnight, if at all. In all likelihood they will get in a car if they have to pay less.

Let's look at Uber for a moment. We know they have about 900,000 drivers in the US, and those drivers generated about $2.5 billion in sales in 2019. That's about $28,000 of revenue per driver.

With 1.1 million drivers (uber and taxi . . . didn't add in lyft here) @$30,000, if prices were to drop by 30% (no driver) and tesla were to take about 15% of that, then we have about $20 billion in driver revenue, and 3 billion in profit.

That's essentially the ENTIRE market and assumes no competition.

The ride hailing business may be a good business, but the profits are not likely to pan out so well given the competitive landscape. (Note that there are many active autonomous ride hailing services now, in limited areas).

Guru..!
2 years ago•Last reply 6 days ago!! trump blames the fed with interest rate hikes as the cause to be concerned. in reality, he should blame his two previous predecessors for their lack of discipline in reigning in spending and allowing our legislature to budget our welfare both corporate and public inclusive of over militarization in the middle east, korea, europe and a few other places where we spend billions to trillions on end keeping armies and active military in parts of the world where we have no business being. the days of kicking that can of debt farther down the long road has perhaps come to an end and this cycle of glut will now be decided only by those companies and investors who can maneuver their capital to benefit their bottom lines. as an investor, my cards are protected and my positions are covered in a stacked series of calls and puts. i have no fear of walking through this crisis.

6 days ago•Last reply 6 days ago!! Norway's EV sales for the month are essentially complete now (they are real time), and VW sold 33% of EVs in Norway, with the best seller (VW ID.3 @ 18.6%) and the 4th best seller (Audi e-tron @ 6.3%).

Tesla's entries came in 2nd, with the Model 3 taking 10.6% and 13.7% for all models.

Polestar sold 8.7% this month while MG came in with 6.3%.

Again, sticking with the competition angle, note that there were 49 different models sold this month alone! There are a lot of other options out there, and the new ones are taking share from Tesla (VW ID.3 and Polestar namely).

2 years ago•Last reply 6 days ago!! Those who are interested in Tesla's 2018Q3 results can be divided into three camps.

a) Short sellers and critics of Tesla
b) The Faithful of the Congregation of Tesla Shareholders
c) Those of weakening faith who still hold Tesla shares

Short sellers and critics can be ignored. They do not hold shares in Tesla nor are the Q3 results likely to prompt them to buy.

The Faithful hold it as an Article of Faith that Q3 will be profitable and cash flow positive. They are unlikely to buy more shares upon release of Q3 results. Their faith would have already prompted them to buy if they were inclined to do so. As a matter of faith, they are likely to continue to hold no matter how bad the results may be.

It is those whose faith is wavering who hold the fate of the Tesla share price in their hands. They are withholding their funds from buying pending confirmation of the predictions of profits and positive cash flow.

Whatever their privately held thoughts of profit and cash flow, reported results must exceed their expectations to prompt those of wavering faith to buy. Any shortfall from their expectations is likely to prompt them to sell.

Any bump in share price is likely to be temporary. Those of wavering faith will soon turn their thoughts to "What is the encore to continue to drive the share price higher?" Those whose faith is wavering, by nature, are cynics. Reasons to sell are easy to find. Reasons to sell need not even have anything to do with Tesla. There must always be new reasons just to continue to hold much less to buy.

In the absence of continual encouragement, those whose faith is wavering will continue to drive a declining price trend with their selling, punctuated by occasional dead cat bounces..!
2 years ago•Last reply 6 days ago!! If sales are increasing, and will continue to increase, shouldn't the Customer Deposits number be growing? Tesla reports that the Customer Deposits number declined slightly because they "continue to work through our Model 3 backlog." That makes no sense; for every Model 3 "$1000-reservation holder" that converts to an actual order-to-purchase there is an instant increase, by at least 4 times, to the amount that customer contributes to the Customer Deposits number (the customer goes from having made a $1000 "reservation" to making a $4000+ deposit for an actual order)..!

6 days ago•Last reply 6 days ago!! I thought I saw a news headline from an EV reporting source that Tesla has already released 3rd Q record breaking numbers. I did not get the entire article. If so, the price really has not moved much due to the news. The source was said to be some one close to the matter. ???.!
6 days ago!! Now we learn that it was in reference to Tesla achieving a record delivery volume during the week, according to sources familiar with the matter.

It came after Musk sent an email to employees during the previous week to inform them that record deliveries for the quarter were achievable, but they needed to deliver “the most number of vehicles per day that we would ever have to deliver.”

While the total number of deliveries during the quarter is still unknown, it looks like Tesla might have achieved Musk’s goal.

Wall Street has high expectations with a delivery estimate consensus of roughly 140,000 vehicles — rising from 123,000 just a few weeks ago.

Tesla is expected to release its Q3 delivery and production results by the end of the week.

Electrek’s Take
I am a bit confused about this quarter. Most delivery estimates are between 135,000 and 145,000 vehicles and they seem to be based on what Tesla needs to get to be on pace to achieve its targeted 500,000 deliveries for the full year.

However, Elon indicated that they have “a shot at record quarter for deliveries.”

Considering Tesla’s last record deliveries were 112,000 vehicles, it would put this quarter closer to that range.

However, as I mentioned in my previous article about the email, Elon always leaves room for interpretation in those emails to all employees.

He could have meant US or North American deliveries only as some have interpreted it, but the email was sent out to all employees globally, and in previous similar emails, he was referring to Tesla’s global deliveries..!
6 days ago!! TSLA is a good bet right now. ELON MUSK didn't not tweet again, it is a good sign for us. He already knows that TSLA will break a new record again. I bought TSLA since battery day. i will hold it until it reports the earnings at the fourth week of Oct..!

6 days ago•Last reply 6 days ago!! In last night's debate, Biden exceeded the low bar set for him by Trump, Republicans, and even Democrats themselves. Many thought Biden would drop out of the debate but Biden actually survived it. The moderator, Chris Wallace, was universally described as awful.

So what did we "learn" in the debate?

We learned the self-described "empathetic," "caring" Biden arrogantly told President Trump to "shut up," savagely calling the President a "clown," "racist," and "liar." Democrats such as Biden (48-year career Washington DC insider politician) relentlessly throw personal insults at opponents, while simultaneously playing the victim. President Trump is a doer; Biden is just a talker who has done nothing in 48 years, except tell black people "you ain't black." Biden's always talking, talking, talking, .......

We also learned President Trump criticized Biden's policy proposals that will destroy the economy. President Trump asked Biden: Why aren't any police departments supporting you? Biden said some are. Trump responded: Name one ... we'll wait. Biden: (crickets). Trump asked Biden: Will you raise taxes? Biden: Dahng straight I will. Trump: Joe, will you say you're for Law & Order? Biden: (crickets). Trump: Ok, Biden's answer is No. Trump: Joe, do you support Bernie's New Green Deal? Biden: No. Trump: WOW, that's NEWS! The Bernie Bros will REALLY hate that, Joe! Biden: (crickets). Trump: Joe, everyone knows if you're elected President, the extreme, radical Bernie far-left will dominate your administration. Biden: No they won't. Trump: Oh sure, you signed a Unity Manifesto Agreement with the far-left Bernie/AOC and now you claim you'll stand up to the radical socialists Bernie & AOC? ... NOT! Biden: (crickets).

President Trump will strongly, proudly defend America. Biden (far-left Kamala/Bernie/Omar/Soros/AOC) will "dismantle" America (their actual words).

That's what we learned from last night's debate..!

"Consumer Reports included the 2019 Tesla Model X on its list of least reliable cars, deeming the electric vehicle “more showy than practical.” As Motor Biscuit pointed out, the Model X also came in dead last in 2018, with the worst reliability rating of any vehicle that year. While Kelley Blue Book didn’t give the Model X a full grade, it wouldn’t have been kind based on the publication’s comments about its price tag, recharging time and mobility.

The 2016 and 2017 versions of the Model X also made CR’s recommendations for used cars to avoid buying due to its “much-worse-than-average reliability.”.!

One of the biggest things people don't mention/realize is that China sits on of the world's largest lithium supply (top 3 with Australia/Chile). Tesla, while a leader in the industry, has a disadvantage as they have to source from elsewhere, which inherently increases production cost. I own both $TSLA and $NIO.

However many people, having grown accustom to headlines about GMs solid vehicle sales in recent years, may not realize that they too are not paying any federal corporate taxes..!

BY Reuters
— 7:40 AM ET 09/30/2020
BEIJING, Sept 30 (Reuters) - U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc ( TSLA) is poised to start selling some Model 3 vehicles made in China equipped with cobalt-free lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, two people familiar with the matter said.

Currently the Model 3 electric sedans made at the carmaker's Chinese plant use nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) batteries. The starting price for the vehicles is currently 271,550 yuan ($39,900) after factoring in government subsidies.

Tesla will announce the product change as early as Thursday, the two sources said. They declined to be named as the matter is confidential.

Tesla was not immediately available for comment.

LFP batteries are cheaper to make and contain no cobalt, one of the most expensive metals used in electric vehicle batteries. Tesla will use LFP batteries in all Model 3 vehicles made in China with standard driving ranges, according to the sources.

In China, the world's biggest car market, Tesla sold over 11,000 vehicles, mostly Model 3s, in August. It is also building a new car manufacturing capacity for Model Y sport-utility vehicles in Shanghai and expects to start delivery of them from next year..!
6 days ago•Last reply 6 days ago!! Trump hit the nail on the head,.........................onChris Wallace'sfarleftwacko insistence that the Climate never changed before theindustrial revolution, that the Califreakia fires are the result ofclimate change" (whatapheckingmoron),.................... when he said,... "look I've discussed this with foreign leaders of countries in Europe with huge forests. There are no rampant forest fires there (and strangely enough on the US's east coast),.... the key is proper forestry management". Theseforestsfires are natural phenomena that have been happening since the invention of fire.

What hasn't happened is people crowding into them and then the local wackogovernemntoutlawing proper forestry management that would otherwise keep the forests clean ofdead trees (aka fuel) forforestfires to feed on.

Infactfarleftwackos are actually starting the fires to claimcluelessChris'ignorance is correct.

Whatever happened to those comercials 30 years ago where smokey the bear said "only you can prevent forestfires"?

In califreakia, it's "only you can start aforestfire,... so go do it so we can use it as justification to destroy theUSA".

I mean what is wrong with you people ontheleft?.!

7 days ago!! Walmart Canada is now reserving a total of 130 Tesla Semi trucks, making it one of the largest reservations of electrified trucks in the country. The move comes on the heels of Walmart Canada announcing a major $3.5 billion investment over the next five years aimed to generate significant growth in the business and is aligned with Walmarts global goal to target zero emissions by 2040 announced at Climate Week earlier this month

The $3.5 billion investment will impact every aspect of the business leading to a faster e-commerce experience, two new distribution centres to speed up the flow of products, re-invented and "smarter" stores, an enhanced omni experience and modern digital tools to ensure associates can best serve customers.
Walmart Canada has built a best-in-class supply chain and is continuing to put sustainability at the forefront of its business operations, finding new and innovative ways to reduce its carbon footprint while continuing to focus on safety and delivering value to its customers. Walmart Canada is committed to converting 20 per cent of Walmart's fleet to electric power by the end of 2022, as part of the goal of its broader goal to power its fleet using 100 per cent alternative power by 2028..!

7 days ago!! NOT GOOD FOR TSLA !! BDO said retailers closed 7,282 stores in the first half, which is already beyond the just under 6,000 in all of 2018. A lackluster 2018 holiday season is partly to blame.

"The 2018 holiday season failed to meet expectations, with December retail sales dropping 1.6% from the month prior -- the weakest sales performance since December 2009," the report states.

Ten retailers filed for bankruptcy in the first quarter of 2019, BDO says, including Payless, Gymboree and Charlotte Russe, which together led to the closure of roughly 3,700 stores. Retailers that filed in July and August include Charming Charlie, Barney's, A'gaci and Avenue Stores.

Challenges for retailers so far this year include the government shutdown in January, bad weather across the country and higher cost of goods due to trade tariffs — all of which had consumers closing their wallets..!

7 days ago!! I love articles like Cleantechnica's recent article about Tesla's contribution to saving the world.

There is no doubt that EVs are helping to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and that is a good thing, but let's be clear. EVs have had almost zero effect on oil consumption. (It may be possible to argue that it is helping to reduce the GROWTH in fossil fuel consumption).

Here is the annual consumption figures, direct from the EIA statistics database. The 2020 and 2021 data are estimates and obviously heavily impacted by COVID-19.

Motor Gasoline (million barrels/day)
2016 - 9.32
2017 - 9.33
2018 - 9.33 <---- This is when the Tesla Model 3 was introduced
2019 - 9.31
2020 - 8.27 <--- That's an 11.2% drop expected for the year
2021 - 9.08 <--- That's down 2.5% from 2019, and likely due to unemployment, not EVs

To date, there is almost ZERO effect on fuel usage, and that doesn't include Diesel, Jet Fuel, etc.

EVs are wonderful, but they haven't impacted gas usage in any meaningful way yet and likely won't for another decade. The biggest contributor (as you can clearly see) is a partial ban on travel, and that only takes about about 15% of fuel consumption (and that includes Jet Fuel).

You people have got to calm down, you are investing in one of the strongest stocks in the market, Tesla will not fail, Elon Musk will not fail.
What happened this week was brilliant, all the weak hands sold their stocks due to fear, new investors came in with a better price, and now strong hands are holding Tesla.
This is what we need.

Entering 2020, the Democrat Party knew the 28 Democrat Presidential Primary candidates not named Biden (e.g., Bill DeBlasio, Kamala Harris, Beto O'Rourke) had zero chance of defeating President Trump. So a Democrat political strategist concocted the Democrats' insane Long-Shot Strategy to defeat President Trump ... and the desperate Democrats instantly put that strategy into motion:

The George Soros-financed Democrats knew the Communist China Party (CCP) Wuhan virus (Wu-Flu) was spreading throughout the world. So the Democrat Party decided: Let's disgracefully take advantage of and misuse the CCP Wu-Flu Global Pandemic against the U.S. & President Trump because it's our only chance for election victory. We'll wait for the perfect opportunity (during the Global Pandemic) to perpetrate mass chaos & destruction throughout the U.S. As you've seen, Democrats are using their typical Election-Year tactic of falsely accusing everyone else of being a "racist," falsely claiming there's "rampant systemic racism" throughout the U.S. Hypocritical Democrats/Black Lives Matter are basically saying, Ignore the 7,000 black people killed annually by other black people (mostly by young black men); instead, we hypocritical Democrats cherry-picked one case, that of the violent career criminal George Philbin, to perpetrate ongoing, nationwide violent riots & chaos throughout the U.S. The desperate Democrats (and their many far-left allies) instantly went into Hyper-Drive, constantly screaming about "Black Lives Matter," that there's suddenly "rampant systemic racism" throughout the U.S., and describing the violent fiery riots as "peaceful protests." The Marxist violent BLM/Antifa organization has been perpetrating its ongoing mob riots in 55+ major Democrat-run cities throughout the U.S. for 125 straight days (with no end in sight) during this Election Year. The Marxist AOC posted an Instagram video in which she says Trump's nomination of a woman to the Supreme Court must wildly "Radicalize" all Democrats. Also, Democrats are perpetrating a totally unprecedented, nationwide, ginormous (and easily corruptible) mail-in balloting campaign. The Democrat mail-in ballot scheme guarantees that Nov. 3 cannot possibly result in a definitive Presidential election outcome on that day. Instead, Democrats have planned to spend many more months (maybe a year) after the election so desperate Democrats can continue endlessly "counting all ballots," endlessly filing lawsuits against the U.S., many states, and local jurisdictions, etc. The main purpose of all this? To satisfy George Soros's Master Scheme of totally destabilizing the U.S. political system. Soros & the far-left Democrat Party desperately seek to entirely "dismantle the whole system" of the U.S. (actual quote from U.S. Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar).

But all of that is not enough for desperate Democrats. Kamala Harris and Sleepy Joe Biden, in their speeches last week, both repeatedly talked up the "Harris Administration." Kamala Harris said her "Harris Administration" will be very progressive while Joe Biden talked up the "Harris/Biden Administration." Mere coincidence? Nope. That's the Harris/Biden signal to the Bernie Bro's that once Biden is elected President, Sleepy Joe will quickly resign so U.S. President Kamala Harris can quickly take over and enact Marxist Bernie Sanders' far-left agenda to "dismantle" the U.S. That fits in perfectly with George Soros's Master Scheme to subjugate the U.S. under Soros's planned borderless, global open-society central government. BTW, Kamala's voting record proves she's the most far-left Senator (even farther left than Bernie), based on the non-partisan organization GovTrack's research report. That report forced the far-left CNN to publicly admit Kamala's "voting record in the Senate certainly is one of the most liberal." Actually, it's THE most liberal. Kamala has repeatedly voted against many of Trump's federal judge nominees and Trump's selections for top positions in his own administration. Nevertheless, Biden's BLM/Antifa-controlled Democrat handlers still continue their Biden-in-a-Basement "campaign." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi continues demanding that Biden refuse to participate in Presidential Debates and stay in his basement.

Yet even that is not enough for desperate Democrats. The angry, far-left CNN political analyst, Gloria Borger, yesterday talked up Democrat Senators boycotting their required meetings with Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett and even boycotting the Senate hearings for Ms. Coney Barrett. Even worse, a growing number of mainstream Democrats are now screaming that Democrats must "burn down" everything because President Trump nominated a woman to the U.S. Supreme Court.

That is the current state of today's Democrat Party..!

11 days ago•Last reply 7 days ago!! TSLA options/option expiration always play a significant part in the share price dynamic. Sometimes huge, ie the biggest factor on a short term basis, ie , days, hours , minutes as it approaches expiration. Last week was an example, where the whole week it played a role in boosting the shares. This week the expiration is for TSLA a relatively low open interest/ low dollar value, with the LDV strike at $400, however the dollar value for strikes $380-415 are essentially the same, and even further away from that ie $360- 425 are higher but not to the amount that we usually see. So what does it mean? That the trading today will not be dominated by the option expiration LDV to a great extent. Now it is possible for that to change to a small degree late in the day if there is a build up in open interest earlier , depending on the state of the unwind, but even then more than likely this will be a day that TSLA will trade mainly on other factors surrounding investor/traders positioning for today and next week etc..!

“Tesla challenger Xpeng to get US$587 million from Guangzhou government to power growth, build new factory.”
And some are upset that Tesla has and is getting too much taxpayer incentives? Therefore, Tesla has to raise its own capital (profits, borrowed or stock sale) and go it alone in competing with the government supported Chinese electric car manufacturers. Xpeng is receiving free government grants. Then China will start dumping EVs in America cutting prices below their cost to drive Tesla out of business. China has done this before with steel, heavy equipment, car manufacturing, shipping, aircraft and many other US job killing unfair trade practices. To level the playing field either heavily tariff their imports or give Tesla half a billion to compete..!

So much can be learned from an hour DD. I have read a comparison of “like intel is to computers”. Also Zero motorcycles said it was like a supercharger for their High Permanence.

The real run is coming. Big multiplier when you buy in at 1.33cdn.

This is not advice, but rather a gift to those who take the time.

IMHO, this will become a CORE holding for many, Ai algorithm, covered by patients and did I mention licensing revenue stream? Boom !

If you have a look and like what you see, see you on the Bulls Boards.

Once again this is not pumping, its sharing, something to little people do now a days. I hope you some pay it forward, should EXRO work extremely well for you based on your entry point.

8 days ago•Last reply 8 days ago!! I am perhaps the "most long " on TSLA of anyone who posts on this board. I own MANY MANY thousands of shares. Yet I tell you , in my role as the REAL DEAL W, retired option market maker, here for strictly philanthropic reasons, to give back a small portion of what the industry has given me, that the extremists on this board have NO CLUE of reality. I posted many times that the highs in TSLA achieved post split were based on a bubbalicous froth due to a rare confluence of circumstances that were truly HISTORIC in magnitude, and as such, the highs reached at that point, aprox $533 in premarket would likely prove to be VERY DURABLE, timewise. Yet we still see EXTREME pumpers speak about "easily" eclipsing those highs and not only ecslipsing them , but going on to huge gains beyone them, not in the long term, but in the short term, ie months , ie this year etc. That is not what happens when a truly HISTORIC bubblalicious top is made.................

2 years ago•Last reply 8 days ago!! Consumer Reports can no longer recommend the newest Tesla—the Model 3 electric sedan—because members say they’ve identified a number of problems with their cars, including issues with its body hardware, as well as paint and trim. CR members reported these results in our annual reliability survey, which includes data on about 470,000 vehicles.

The Model 3 is a critical car for Tesla. It’s the automaker’s first attempt at a true mass-market electric vehicle (EV), and its long, bumpy launch into the consumer market starting in late 2017 was greeted by EV enthusiasts with a mixture of anticipation and frustration. The Model 3 rollout was plagued by numerous production delays and extraordinarily long wait times for customers who put down orders more than a year before delivery. Yet the small sports sedan has been received well by its owners, getting top marks in CR’s most recent owner satisfaction survey. It has also largely lived up to its promise as a highly competitive sports sedan, earning a respectable road-test score, which puts it not far behind the Audi A4 and BMW 3 Series.

But reliability has been a weak spot for Tesla. According to our survey results, problems with the suspension, especially with the 2017 model year, have been an issue for the Model S luxury sedan, while hardware problems—especially concerning its unique falcon-wing doors—have plagued the Model X SUV (neither is currently recommended by CR). And now our latest survey data has surfaced numerous problems reported by Model 3 owners as well, which is why CR has removed its recommendation for the vehicle.

“While Teslas perform well in Consumer Reports’ road tests and have excellent owner satisfaction, their reliability has not been consistent, according to our members, which has resulted in changes to their recommended status,” says Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing at Consumer Reports.

Tesla currently holds the top spot on our list of brands that satisfy owners the most, based on their new vehicle lineup.

“In most cases, reliability issues will undermine satisfaction,” Fisher adds. “But when a vehicle has an enthusiastic following, like with Tesla, owners may overlook some issues. We’ve seen this with other vehicles such as the Jeep Wrangler and Chevrolet Corvette.”.!

Bubble is deflating fast as Demand to consume all EVs that getting produced is slowly softening.

China is great example. Largest market by far for EV and Elon just launch Model 3 and yet hardly able to keep 10% market share and not able sell all it can produce.

Demand and not supply ultimately define Stock price and Demand is slowing faster than anyone bull like..!
8 days ago!! You should know the new 4680 is still in prototyping stage. It is put in some production Tesla vehicles but for experiments only. The expectation is that the consumers can only buy cars with 4680 battery in 2022, maybe in 2021. It is put in production Tesla vehicles but not for sale to the public. I guess Tesla employees can buy them for alpha testing. Some articles from analysts emphasis 4680 battery are put in production vehicles are misleading. In short, Battery Day is not a success. There must be some flaw Elon Musk found in the lab, so Battery Day is unofficially delayed to 2022..!

8 days ago•Last reply 8 days ago!! George Soros said: "The main obstacle to a stable and just world order is the United States."

George Soros said: "The main enemy of the open society, I believe, is no longer the communist but the capitalist threat."

George Soros said: "... the United States constitutes a serious threat to the peace and prosperity of the world."

In addition, George Soros frequently says he's on a mission to create one borderless, global "open society."

So, based solely on the stated beliefs and actual words of the radical, anti-U.S. zealot George Soros, these are the indisputable facts: George Soros believes the U.S. is a despicable, unjust country; George Soros believes American "capitalism" is his "main enemy"; George Soros thinks American "capitalism" is far worse than "communism"; and George Soros believes "the United States" is an extremely deadly "serious threat to the peace and prosperity of the world."

Those are the reasons that the extreme, anti-U.S. zealot George Soros gives for his maniacal mission (in conjunction with the far-left Democrat Party and all its allies) to totally destabilize and dismantle the United States of America ....... during this Election Year. And that's why George Soros is spending virtually all of his many tens of billions of dollars of wealth (that he earned in the U.S.) on doing exactly that.

Here is something that the vile, anti-U.S. zealot George Soros definitely does not want you to know -- George Soros's entire borderless global open-society Master Scheme totally hinges upon George Soros defeating President Trump in this election.

So wouldn't it be great for all American citizens to join together as one, re-elect President Trump, and totally stick it to that totally ungrateful, anti-U.S. zealot George Soros?

You bet your sweet aarhse it would.

P.S. George Soros's native Hungary and England have BOTH accused George Soros of intentionally undermining and deliberately destabilizing their respective countries. Do you see any pattern there?.!

8 days ago•Last reply 8 days ago!! As reality comes into sharper focus, it’s increasingly clear that myriads of newly minted EVs will be competing for market share across the transportation sector.

Five years is a long time, TSLA’s present market capitalization is based on the assumption that in FIVE YEARS all the following investment sectors will be dominated by TSLA.
1) auto manufacturing
2) energy production
3) energy storage
4) solar roof manufacturing
5) solar roof installation
6) rare earth mining
7) battery manufacturing
8) tunnel construction
9) space travel
10. Mars colonization

Simple domination in these investment sectors isn’t sufficient to account for TSLAs stratospheric market capitalization......TSLA must destroy all competition, to justify TSLAs valuation,
traditional valuation metrics must be entirely rewritten.

"There’s also a cost advantage from using more plentiful, and cheaper, raw materials. Natron sells battery systems to data center customers at a similar price to both existing lead-acid packs and lithium-ion products, but it says its technology winds up being three times cheaper over the long term because of the life span of the battery."

But you can believe that Tesla is going to have 300GWh of a 155GWh industry where the competitors are vast, strong and have a whole range of solutions (note the Fuel Cell is also expected to be less expensive than Li-ON batteries).!

8 days ago•Last reply 8 days ago!! 👀 READ TSLA After the pandemic, we have seen a surge of Zombie Companies. These are a category of companies that just like a virus, are sucking up the lifeblood out of government aid and cheap credit, thanks to the central banks. These are called Zombie Companies. They are Companies that are refusing to close their doors despite being unable to pay off their debts, instead of feeding off government aid or cheap credit from central banks. Zombie corporations are those who cannot cover their debt servicing costs from current profits over an extended period of time. Basically, companies that never made a profit never will make a profit and need Fed's cheap and easy money to survive. Every company that has to do with fracking, Tesla, WeWork, a few dozen tech unicorns in the IPO line, and probably a whole bunch of office REITs, hotels, and airlines for starters. If a company has had at least the past three years, during which the profits it earned were not enough to pay off its debts, we call it (that is the financial press calls it) a zombie company..!

9 days ago•Last reply 8 days ago!! Tesla's market share for all EVs

- Europe - 9% (LOTS of new competition still to come, and EU is now the largest EV market in the world)
- China - 12.9% (competition has been entrenched for a while, but still new players coming. 2nd largest mkt)
- US - 48.6% (Almost no competition; market is 1/3 the size of Europe currently)

Overall, Tesla currently has 15.8% market share for these major markets. But the ramp of competition is really just starting. VW alone will sell 100,000 or more EVs in the second half of this year. And they are just starting with the delivery of ID.3. ID.4 deliveries will start around the world in November/December so it could be more.

This all bodes well for saving the planet . . .

Don't be delusional about Tesla market share. When there is competition, Tesla's position is whittled away in all price ranges.

Guru..!

That is based on his idea that the Chinese government not allowing a network of FSD cars with American tech running around the country. That is pretty stupid view to take as it is pretty easy to setup the brains capturing the driving behaviour for Chinese customers within China and even hand it over to the Chinese Communist party if they want it. Tesla does not need to have access to that data in the US. They just need the data that is ring fenced to operate their Chinese business. Any perceived problem with that can be easily resolved. The brand image lead that Tesla has in China will be very hard to overcome for any Chinese brand..!

But on the other hand this is not just an EV manufacturer that is making more cars than any other company. This is a company that is revolutionizing every part of the manufacturing process. Do you realize that it created a process with casting that a part of one of its cars I think the back end can be assembled in one piece. Do you understand how huge this is. This company cannot be valued accurately because no company has every created manufacturing processes and technologies in any industry prior. We are witnessing technology created at warp speed that every other company will want to emulate. Given the advances made by TSLA once Berlin and Austin Gigas are open and operating at full capacity it is not unrealistic to expect TSLA to sell millions of cars a year. No other company in the world will ever catch up or create such innovative and disruptive technologies..!

But why people ignoring reason tesla getting into bettery manufacturing and weather they account for everything or rushing?

First why they entering:- What they reveal in battery day was shock. They not able to improve battery cost at all for last few years. Big Big deal specially when material cost is significant down over years.

Their promise to decrease cost is based on various planning and we all know nothing ever go as per plan. In case of Elon more it planned, more it go other way. He will sleep there to fix problem created by rushing and sometime able to turn around, other time end up worst way ( Example is FSD which is now 3rd rewrite iteration and he is again excited and want to rush to market. He didn't learn from earlier rewrite & expensive hardware replacement because he sell with fully function FSD car on hardware wise..).!
8 days ago!! It's not quite end of day in Norway, but close . . . here is the latest daily results:

VW ID.3 - 199 vehicles or 26% of today's deliveries
Tesla Model 3 - 83 vehicles or 18% of today's deliveries
Others (26 other models were sold) - 257 vehicles or 56%

For the month,
VW ID.3 has taken 18% share - All VW vehicles have about 32%
Tesla (all models) have taken 13.7% share
Polestar has taken 9.1% share and
MG has taken 6.1% share.

8 days ago!! Tesla: Pay No Taxes, Take More Handouts
For at least a year now we have heard complaints from GM and Tesla about the need to extend the electric vehicle (EV) tax credit, with just these two companies upset that their gravy train is coming to an end. These companies insist that it is crucial that the EV tax credit be expanded and extended, and have convinced a few members of Congress to introduce a bill to do just that. One could pass it off as just your standard rent-seeking of the sort that goes on every day in Washington, but a funny thing about these two rent-seekers: they don’t pay taxes. That’s right, the two companies demanding more taxpayer subsidies don’t even pay corporate income taxes.

The EV tax credit is manufacturer specific and begins to phase out once a company has sold 200,000 eligible vehicles. GM and Tesla hit both that threshold last year, the only companies that have done so. Taxpayers are still on the hook for the full EV tax credit for every other car company, adding up to billions of dollars, and even GM and Tesla buyers will continue to be eligible for reduced credits for a while. Billions already out the door, with billions more committed, but still not enough for GM and Tesla. In a shameless display, these two companies—who pay no corporate tax—insist that they should get even more in subsidies from the rest of us..!

8 days ago•Last reply 8 days ago!! People now start inflating on Battery claim and I love it. Look like I might start buying put soon.

Here is reason I think people should worried what they paying and book profit or avoid big losses risk. There are many other reason biggest demand but I will focus on battery day for now.

1.> Battery day, while people don't like it's 3 full Elon Year away ( Elon Year factor normally is 1.5x-5x and I think this likely near 3x+ at least given complete restructure and based on Event it look like it's just in 1 year which mean they yet to do proper validation of technology.).
2.> Even bigger thing people ignored, how analyst wrong when they thought Tesla already closer to $100 kwh cost with cost advantage, what they revealed is last few years cost hardly improved even with lower material cost. It's reason Tesla take such risky route.
3.> Also all factory efficiency claim likely turn out bogus, more dense factory may be cheaper but much harder to keep running as repair can get tricky and required shutting non impacted unit as well. Also everything have tight dependancy on other unit efficiency.
3.> Tabless design look good and logical but there is also big risk. Reason it was not used before - gain is not significant for electronics but fire risk is very increase significantly. . If there is leak, It will explode. Sure with technology you can make it very less chance but you need 1 bad apple. Sure They can improve by 5-10% efficiency but does it worth risk.
3.> Bigger cell design again made possible with tabless design which reduce heating due to shorter more paradelle possitive/negative nodes. But remember if just one of those bad, you now have 1 cell = 5-6 previous cell worth fire power. Again fire risk multiply by factor of 5-6.
4.> Silicone solution is worst in my opinion. Probably not properly test with extreme conditions. This is where most delay in my opinion ( Along with tab-less connections quality control issue)
5.> Remember Tesla choose most volatile chemistry of li-ion battery basically insake of density it take risky battery. With bigger and bigger cell, less and less separation between two nodes, it becoming risky. It sound like Elon trying to test extreme limit of this volatile chemistry. Not saying Elon dump and ignoring but he is risk taker.
5.> There are 10 different solid state battery technology evolving around world which much much supperior.
On other end Elon think it's next to impossible to produce solid state battery in economically viable way.

Overall While if Elon success in 4-5 year can bring Tesla some edge, It's not as much (Other are going to improving same time. Infact they are in pressure to respond and They working hard already.)
If Solid state battery are mass produced even might expensive, it's game over for Tesla billions of investment as next to worthless..!

8 days ago•Last reply 8 days ago!! So let's work on more math . . . LG Chem produces about 50GWh of battery capacity at the end of 2019 and is expecting production to increase to about 100GWh by end of 2020 (working on a plant with GM for 50GWh of capacity.)

They are expected to be valued at $24 billion in 2024 (that's from Cleantechnica), and by that time they are expected to have over 200GWh of production capacity.

So 200GWh of production capacity (or more) should be valued at $24 billion. Hmmm. Does that mean that Tesla's 10GWh production plans or even 100GWh production plans are seriously over valued? Perhaps, but I'm just being a rational human being.

Today, the base pay of those at the top is commonly 400 times that of their salaried staff, with many earning orders of magnitude more in stock options and perks. Not enough for Elon Musk

Elon Musks 1.7 million Tesla share options vested in May 2020 with a presplit strike price or $350.02. Using the current $375 share price the compensation cost to the company would then be $1525 * 1.7 million or $2.6 billion or 7 times the reported earnings for the last 4 quarters combined
In 2016 Musk was awarded 6.7 M share options for a net value $1.34 Billion and in 2018 Musk was awarded $2.3 Billion

There is no $25,000 tesla anymore than there's the long ago promised $35,000 model 3.

Just like there was no autonomous drive across the US by the end of 2017. 2018, 2019, 2020,... or

500,000 deliveries out of Fremont by 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021,... or

and the list of failed fake promises for whicj musk should be injailgoes on and on.

8 days ago!! With the efficiency being introduced on each giga factory and the improvement in productivity the end result might be that the current estimate for how many giga factory produced to deliver x number of vehicles will need to be revised. I think we are looking at half the estimated giga factory to produce the same number of vehicles. In other words if the current estimate is 20 factories then accounting for the efficiency we are seeing we might be looking at 10 factories which will result in half the time in years to get there. This is exponential growth people!.!
