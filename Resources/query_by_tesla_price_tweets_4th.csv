2020-07-10T23:17:43.000Z,I reckon i have lost maybe 4000 bucks trying to short Tesla. I cut when i see very strong price action.  I just don't agree with the bull case. But it wouldn't be the first thing i was wrong about. And won't be the last.

2020-07-10T22:51:34.000Z,I like Tesla as a brand name and its position in EV's and use of Autonomous Driving software is definitely unassailable. But recently one has to take into consideration that it's share price is overvalued and there are some reports of shady accounting policies.

It would make a great #RobotTaxi

Steering wheel could be optioned into the LR AWD and Performace.  It would also make an awesome driver’s car due it’s size and weight."
2020-07-08T20:27:14.000Z,"It's tough because they've changed the price structure several times. Autopilot used to be a paid feature, Enhanced Autopilot, and then FSD was a small upgrade on top of that. Now EAP is dropped and the whole cost is FSD."

2020-07-08T19:28:11.000Z,So what I mean is that FSD’s real price is more so $10K instead of the $8K that’s listed because of AP being automically included.
2020-07-08T19:27:25.000Z,Not necessarily. When Tesla included AP with all cars they increased the base price by $2K in 2019. So it’s technically still there just not as obvious to the buyer.

2020-07-06T04:17:09.000Z,Maybe do the next shorts at $42.69 and $420.69 (for the FSD upgrade) or just price every future Tesla products with 420 & 69

2020-07-06T03:00:00.000Z,Despite founder Elon Musk's tweet that its share price was too high — which helped wipe $14 billion off Tesla's value in May — mounting investor interest in electric vehicles has driven a nearly five-fold market growth in capitalization over the past year. #Tesla @elonmusk

It worked out, but Tesla needed to tap equity markets regularly"

2020-07-06T02:17:06.000Z,Considering that owners help train the tesla neural network. In my opinon an owner should be able to keep the price they paid for FSD.

2020-07-06T02:06:39.000Z,"No the point is that when trading in a Tesla, seems like the trade in value is based on the price of car not including FSD. It is a sunk cost.  Person trading in a tesla needs to purchase it again for their next tesla."

2020-07-06T01:21:22.000Z,I think 4.20 is a good price
2020-07-06T01:18:35.000Z,The reason from other OEMs u don’t see that is because of dealer network. Dealers buy at bulk price per contract and then dealers do the quarter end pushes that’s all. I get lots of quarter end pushes from dealers.

2020-07-05T01:00:12.000Z,"Elon says in a tweet - 
“Tesla stock price is too high imo”.."
2020-07-05T00:49:49.000Z,"Brand inflation. 3 weeks ago I bought my 2yr old 340i with a few miles for the same price as a brand new Honda Civic. Either way, it's really all about brand recognition. Tesla is considered high end... Until you realize that no one keeps their tesla after the warranty expires."
2020-07-05T00:27:16.000Z,For who?  Nobody would have benefitted past that price.  Private right now would be a horrible thing.
2020-07-05T00:14:27.000Z,News reported our governor met w/Elon Musk 2 talk abt bringing Tesla 2 Tulsa  I’m thinking Oklahoman’s could use a job other than depending on the price of a barrel of oil. Oklahoma’s politicians didn’t learn  from the last oil bust. We’re all paying for their short memory’s.
2020-07-05T00:13:10.000Z,"Big boost to Tesla’s demand will be from Tesla’s stock price. I expect many investors will be pulling the trigger now, heck seen several making roadster reservations."
2020-07-05T00:05:11.000Z,"You know you lie when you compare the price of an SUV with a much smaller car and also say it's 2.5 times more expensive when the difference between 39k and 24.4k is 1.6 times, right?

With Tesla you get stuff like a security system with like 8 cameras, an app, big screen, etc."
2020-07-05T00:01:10.000Z,"Also most people invest in individual stocks as opposed to an index.  So depending on the stock (ie Tesla, Amazon, and Google) have 300 times the price they were over a decade."

2020-07-04T23:48:49.000Z,Tesla is not a dealership. When I trade it in with them I expect a smooth transaction with FSD to be added to the  trade in price when Elon claims it as an appreciating asset.
2020-07-04T23:36:56.000Z,"500K is possible in 2020. Q3 should be very strong, no limits on output. Even if MY demand flags, price cuts, MY SR+ would help. I think 2021 is key, esp. in 2H, with no new markets, Model Y out for a while - and lots of competition."
2020-07-04T23:25:04.000Z,Thanks for helping the share price bro!!
2020-07-04T22:56:31.000Z,Lol read the article. This is an article that presents factual data about how poorly Tesla is actually representing itself numerically as a company. Stock analysts that just make price targets like $2000 with no data to back it are the thing that you have described in your tweet.
2020-07-04T22:55:36.000Z,"You don’t have to prove me wrong in person, just make it happen, my main concern is how do you make hydrogen on competitive price with Tesla Semi trucks,  hydrogen stations are not cheap, it just doesn’t look like economics work for hydrogen,"

2020-07-04T22:23:57.000Z,"And that's a problem. As you know, Frontline workers went without proper PPE and paid the price.

In other words, we shouldn't accept shitty situations in the name of profit, of which most hospitals are forced to generate.

Healthcare shouldn't be privatized. Too important"

3) Expensive - EVs will be comparable in price in a few years as battery costs plummet. Even now a Tesla Model 3 is comparable to a Honda Accord if you factor in cheap fuel and no maintenance."
2020-07-04T21:54:24.000Z,"So yeah, it would probably be more economical to just sell and buy the same car again in that case, but with the retail price difference, this guy might not be able to afford the same car again - especially when he'll lose money over selling the 1st one and have other fees in EU."
2020-07-04T21:49:10.000Z,"The real estate bubble and price is so high in ShenZhen that a Tesla Model 3 is only worthy of 2-3 square meters of an apartment. Even it is only on paper, but people will feel like a rich man as long as the real estate bubble is still existing."
2020-07-04T21:36:36.000Z,"You only looking at price when you forget about the other problems you will have with importing like charging, safety like SOS button, amber brake lights, plus the hardware and software isn’t calibrated for that country. Those problems are more serious than 15-20k"
2020-07-04T21:30:37.000Z,I have a Lexus SC500Hybrid which I bought in Australia. I would love to import the new Convertible version from Japan but our Aussi rules make it uneconomic despite the incredible $ difference in price
2020-07-04T21:23:15.000Z,"I will thanks to the Tesla stock price. Thank you @elonmusk, I hope you and your family have a wonderful 4th of July. God bless and stay safe."
2020-07-04T21:19:24.000Z,Payoff period for me was like 15 to 20 years. And tbh the price hasn’t really dropped yet. I contemplated it back in 2008 and then again in 2018. It will cost me more in those 15-20 years 4 solar than my electrical bill.

2020-07-04T20:56:24.000Z,"It’s quite simple: cheaper to run/maintain, more efficient, faster, price point reaching parity with ICE. Is the consumer that stupid?"
2020-07-04T20:29:21.000Z,That’s exactly what I commented on. Early cell phones were prohibitively expensive. hard work for years made them affordable. Every year the price of Tesla have dropped. And they’ve put blood sweat & tears to make affordable models. How are you so wrong on so many things?
2020-07-04T20:26:28.000Z,For someone who believes $XRP will become the new gold standard and have never checked $NKLA stock price (since it never reached $100) you really are speculating. I also don’t think Nikola has the time to block Tesla fans like you.
2020-07-04T20:19:05.000Z,"I get the ""Now would you believe it today if someone said that Tesla will triple again in two years? sounds unbelievable, right"" part, but the reply to that mentioned the stock price would certainly be $2700 if FSD rolled out as planned.  So, I don't think I misinterpreted it."

2020-07-04T20:11:19.000Z,"Well, exactly.  But I received Tesla shares for these SolarCity shares and they have been in the black for a long time.  Bankruptcy would have meant that I lost money.

2020-07-04T20:10:12.000Z,"Just utter the words ""digital transformation"" or ""electric vehicle"" and you get at least a 30 price to sales multiple.

2020-07-04T19:35:01.000Z,"I think its fair to say that if the price was really 3x higher for an equivalent product, Tesla would not really sell any.
Because its not like Tesla is known for their luxury interior status."

But Tesla does charge 2x for its autopilot option."

2020-07-04T07:37:01.000Z,"I love BMW i3, why didn't i buy:

1) BMW i3 needs FWD or AWD option
2) More transparent charging. 1 price for all, no creepy deals for BMW only.
3) Train your sales. They need to relax.
4) Match Tesla warranty.

I'll be happy to provide further info. I want you to be successful."

2020-07-04T07:27:56.000Z,"I'm hoping the rumoured $20k Tesla will force some of the old guard manufacturers to lower their EV prices.  I don't understand the obsession with self-driving, I can't see that it'll be legal for 5-10 years.  Reduce complexity and lower the price until then."
2020-07-04T07:23:22.000Z,Jerry - I’m assuming you’re referring to the Price Waterhouse Coopers Initial Quality Survey. That survey is not strictly a manufacturing quality surveys. @TeslaPodcast has a breakdown here:
2020-07-04T07:17:43.000Z,"7k in 2-3 years is really pushing it BUT

If Tesla created an extra 15m shares like they did last year than would mean 15m x $1200 = $18B cash
Each Giga costs around $1B so

Could build 18 Gigafactories AT THE SAME TIME

$7k share price in 2-3 years time EASY

Your welcome :-)"

2020-07-04T06:50:36.000Z,Ask basically every other car manufacturer if they do this and you’ll soon find out none of them do. Yes it can be shipped but that doesn’t fit into the pre-defined cost analysis to define the price of your car. Only idiot here is named Corey.
2020-07-04T06:50:31.000Z,And I think Tesla decided to take those reservation before Elon became CEO? And then Elon had to deal with the fact that anticipated price was very off. It was a disaster indeed.

2020-07-04T06:26:58.000Z,Like for example Tesla vehicles hold their value because of the increasing price of the self driving software. The bag itself would only increase in value to a collector not because of it’s actually worth in my head. Like it in its own doesn’t go up unless no more are made

2020-07-04T04:38:54.000Z,Good point on the price/sales. Not sure if it’s quite oranges to oranges though as Apple was already a profitable computer company pre iPhone. iPhone was just the step change that took them to the next level. Tesla on the other hand didn’t have an existing mature business.
2020-07-04T04:17:39.000Z,"Apple didn't have a price/sales ratio as high then, as Tesla is at now. 

Apple also made a profit in the early years of the iPhone, and they had more cash than debt. 

Tesla doesn't make a profit in most quarters, has a junk credit rating, and a higher valuation."
2020-07-04T04:15:51.000Z,$1000 would be too high if all they sold were books. But the price kept rising and Amazon kept growing and expanding to new markets - and continues to this day. That is Tesla. Ever expanding and growing and innovating. Who know what they will do next except Musk. Stock knows.

And SpaceX has cut the cost of reaching LEO by *an order of magnitude*. The impact of that cannot be overstated."

2020-07-04T03:21:17.000Z,"You’re * Also, yea EVs existed, but weren’t taken seriously because they were produced so terribly. Tesla is literally the first company to mass produce quality EVs at an affordable price - the M3 can be compared with the average price of a car in the US after savings lol"

Tesla’s get into fewer accidents, and when they’re in accidents, fewer people are hurt.

Tesla knows exactly how you drive, and can’t price insurance accordingly."
2020-07-04T01:49:37.000Z,"Are you expecting 130-150k at current product pricing?  Or are you expecting Tesla to cut prices to make demand equal to supply?  If you are expecting price cuts, how much?"

2020-07-04T01:39:27.000Z,It is inevitable that 3/Y isn't affordable for everyone but as technology improves and production scales further coming products will be cheaper and present ones will get price reductions. That is how Tesla has done it in the past and will continue do to.

2020-07-04T00:14:12.000Z,"Although I don’t currently have a Tesla yet, I do own some shares, my own personal feeling is that if FSD improves to the extent that the purchase price rises, this will also be reflected in the shares value rising also, therefore maybe less guilt paying higher later "

2020-07-03T23:54:51.000Z,"Been following you for a decade and invested heavily in Tesla. I wait for the day to see humans on Mars, and I wait to see the world completely electric. The share price is a massive bonus, but its the missions I care about. The future will be better than the past."

2020-07-03T21:58:10.000Z,"Got it. They have fans regardless of the @JDPowerAutos lowest quality brand rating. Still, $TSLA attracts investors who prefer stocks with lottery-like characteristics. Unfortunately, speculative trading produces noise which adversely affects price stability, volatility & risk."
2020-07-03T21:43:29.000Z,Sure! It’s an Ark Invest table from Cathie Wood talking about Tesla share price trajectories
2020-07-03T21:33:27.000Z,"Well on that point MR Green also gets the benefit of owning these vehicles indefinitely thereafter, so part of the motivation for a low price was to avoid a higher upgrade rate starting 7/1. I used a lower take rate in order to account for that difference."
2020-07-03T21:28:26.000Z,@elonmusk I know you dislike short sellers specifically the one put false rumors to bring the price down we are small investors can afford to invest in tesla. I was wondering what advice you would give to a company who was attacked by short sellers for example IDEX
2020-07-03T21:24:29.000Z,$tsla might really go to $22k/share (Cathie Wood prediction)... the math is just hitting me. If you take the shares that say Exxon has and divide it by the amount that Tesla has and times that by current price you get over $22k. Tesla May not issue more shares @ S&P incl. 
2020-07-03T21:23:33.000Z,"Regardless of the price of the cars, Logan bought the Lamborghini for chilly after nearly 7 years of dating. Logan bought the Tesla for Adriana after like 2/3 months of dating. He is just doing shit way too soon in instances like this. Quite irresponsible if you ask me."
2020-07-03T21:20:16.000Z,"What is happening now to Tesla's share price is nonsense & it actually does not help Tesla long term.

Why did Elon say the price is too high?  Partly maybe to pull in some short sellers.  Also maybe because retaining key employees may be harder with the stock so stratospheric."
2020-07-03T21:12:41.000Z,It's interesting though that MrGreen is offering FSD for $39 with abiliy to increase the price if new functionality becomes available or at $65/month fixed price for the remainder of the lease. Could be that @Tesla offering later this year will be priced lower than expected..
2020-07-03T20:54:34.000Z,"Um, everyone of @wolfejosh's statements was accurate. The IPO valuation was silly and it continues to be. TSLA's valuation is based primarily on cult euphoria. His short call March of 2018 did see the price go from $270 to $180. TSLA has been cut in half many times."
2020-07-03T20:42:25.000Z,Is Birkin personally responsible for the recession and pandemic? How would them not selling bags fix either one of those problems? What other luxury items are you upset about? There is a reason you're crapping on a handcrafted fashion item and not the price of a Tesla.
2020-07-03T20:32:58.000Z,Poor video. It said Tesla’s have range but they are expensive. So H2 cars have the advantage on range. But then it turns out H2 cars are equally priced to Tesla’s. Soberst is it: is price an issue or not?

2020-07-01T09:10:32.000Z,Price reductions happened everywhere. But they are not meant to make other stuff more expensive without added value. The idea is to have an affordable EV in the long run.

2020-06-26T16:05:29.000Z,Tesla has been promising 'lowest price for home solar' - but can they deliver? An increasing number of industry experts say no. Read on to find out why:
2020-06-26T15:57:18.000Z,"Using California costs for gas and electricity:

A car that gets 28mpg: $0.11/mile
A Tesla Model 3: $0.03/mile

So actual annual savings for driving 12K miles are year are about $1000.

Charging price for Model 3 would have to be $0.44/kWh to be pricier than the 28mpg car."
2020-06-26T15:57:09.000Z,"Tesla approach is more about hyping up the purported growth story for the stock price than actually making a viable system. Even if Tesla AV tech could work robustly, you can't make a viable robotaxi service with traditional sedan config, you need something purpose-built"

2020-06-25T21:56:48.000Z,Because the goal is to make it affordable for everyone. As cost of production gets cheaper the plan was always to lower the price. Tesla wants as many ppl as possible owning Tesla’s.
2020-06-25T21:55:23.000Z,"Tesla never amended its ""easily surpasses"" 500k deliveries this year. 95k is a massive miss. With multiple new model launches in MIC M3, price cuts in China, Model Y backlog, anything less than 125k for a company priced to perfection is insanity. Don't take my word for it either"

2020-06-04T23:04:46.000Z,"Do the cost per mile. (Total purchase price - $39500)/34k. If CPM is > .55, its a hell no, keep the 3."
2020-06-04T22:36:54.000Z,I make that about $160/kWh INSTALLED PRICE once all that capacity is complete. At that price I would install a battery at every EV charging station without even getting my calculator out.
2020-06-04T22:09:06.000Z,"Unfortunately it specifically excludes Tesla's from the list of qualified cars, due to the new car list price cannot exceed 45K. The starting price of a Model 3 is 49K."
2020-06-04T21:50:33.000Z,"Tesla also says that it isn't guaranteeing a delivery date.  

So this ""option"" doesn't buy you either a set price OR a set delivery date."
2020-06-04T21:35:18.000Z,"Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) price at close, 2020-06-04, is 864.38."
