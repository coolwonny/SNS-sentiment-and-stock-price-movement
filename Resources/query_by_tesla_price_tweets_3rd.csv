2020-07-31T23:48:26.000Z,These are the kind of news that may not move Tesla stock price today but the type of information which gives me confidence as a long term Tesla investor! 
2020-07-31T23:28:26.000Z,Block trading desks building inventory for index funds in anticipation of S&P inclusion. Probably explains recent price action. The announcement maybe non event if they have enough supply
2020-07-31T23:26:44.000Z,Can someone explain what Tesla actually to deserve the sudden huge boost in stock price?   I mean besides openly admitting he is a Trumpturd.
2020-07-31T23:09:54.000Z,You can have a Tesla performance for that price and never pay for gas or service. Plus it will Drive You!!
2020-07-31T23:01:47.000Z,"Bubbles happen when price goes up faster than revenue.

In Tesla's case, revenue grew doubled every 18 months for over half a decade while the price was constant. The recent rise is just mean reversion to past price multiples"
2020-07-31T23:01:27.000Z,I'm happy because its giving me an opportunity to buy more at a good price. In long-term we know which direction Tesla is going.
2020-07-31T22:44:10.000Z,All shorts are naked. You borrow shares from someone and sell them  You have to buy them back later hopefully at a lower price and give them back. Tesla’s run up in price is typical of a blow off top. 20 percent in one day. It’s a good bet that it’s in a long term downtrend IMO.
2020-07-31T22:35:08.000Z,Tesla model 3 will leave this overpriced dinosaur standing. Disgraceful price for a ‘CS’ badge.
2020-07-31T22:34:13.000Z,Near far wherever you are i belive that tesla is the best and they should colab with microsoft and make a tesla model 360 with a built in xbox and a billion pounds as a vonus all for the nice price of £0.01
2020-07-31T22:29:53.000Z,"Automotive News asked him what was going on with the soaring price of Tesla shares,"
2020-07-31T22:25:40.000Z,"Basically. Which is a model which will work. The starlink model makes no sense though. It’s a Silicon Valley VC model, create enough buzz and the share price will go up and make you rich, regardless of the actual value. Like Tesla."

2020-07-31T21:47:49.000Z,Agreed. I want to support shell and others stations here in canada to be supportive/encourage them to do more. Tesla's superchargers are obviously the best price/convenience/performance but the more the better.

2020-07-31T20:32:25.000Z,$TSLA Ok here is some info on where $TSLA is now.  Tesla been consolidating the past 3 weeks. As you can see in the graph below the price is getting squeezed. I’m expecting a YUGE movement next week. It could happen the following week. The triangle is solid though it may expand
2020-07-31T20:31:51.000Z,Sounds like Demand is dropping hence the x number of price drops we have seen from Tesla this year.
2020-07-31T20:21:20.000Z,"Same here.  They have agreements with clients and have to post gains--which only count when you cash out!  I'm sympathetic to them.

I do think that Ross is underplaying Tesla's growth.  600x earnings will *very* soon be 50x, 30x, 10x at this price."
2020-07-31T20:15:28.000Z,"Yup, all that helps, and the low price point is super attractive. Could be the right choice for some folks. Maybe even most. But I do think it’s risky. I work in Vermont, where most homes are...unique...which colors my perspective."
2020-07-31T20:09:33.000Z,"Before you wrote your article, did you ever look at the price graph of Tesla? The reason I ask is do you think it would be possible that people would front-run the event you are talking about... ?"
2020-07-31T20:03:22.000Z,I think she was trying to say people hype up owning a Tesla over a Lexus but yet they cost almost the same in price so they’re not that expensive lmao I think that’s what she was getting at
2020-07-31T19:44:54.000Z,  That will surely mean the share price will drop due to production issues!!! 
2020-07-31T19:33:02.000Z,"Today Tesla acquired bond for a lower than market price. This means the company gets 780mil in cash for operation which will speed  their projects faster and faster. In another word, buy #TSLA!!!"
2020-07-31T19:20:39.000Z,Where did you pull “Tesla becomes obsolete” from? “Peak share price”?  There is no Tesla becoming obsolete or peak share price given their level of increasing innovation with the brightest staff throughout the world. One more try.
2020-07-31T19:02:40.000Z,ARK Invest's price target is based on a <20% market share for Tesla.
2020-07-31T19:01:03.000Z,"Yea, with that much power they really didn't use it well. I'd at least buy a bunch of stock in some company and then skyrocket the price. Like if Apple announced it was acquiring Tesla or something."
2020-07-31T18:44:55.000Z,"The top is around 20k usd. The bottom is zero. I'm comfortable buying around 9k usd and below. Any time the price hits 9k I buy as much as I can.  If it gets lower I buy more. When the price goes to 10k I sell some. 11k I sell some more. 

Rinse repeat until Lambo or Tesla"
2020-07-31T18:41:28.000Z,"Tesla perfects auto driving but the price, the price is very steep"
2020-07-31T18:32:25.000Z,"Idk about y10, but Amazon’s p/e was VERY briefly as high as 3000 ish. As I say further in the thread, companies just hitting profitability can have skewed p/e. To note though, looking at price/rev, Tesla hit the $300B cap at 1/2 the revenues that Amazon had when it hit $300B."
2020-07-31T18:31:26.000Z,And don’t even mention the Tesla Cybertruck that blows the others out of the water at a better price point and likely to see deliveries much sooner.

2020-07-31T18:18:48.000Z,I sold $70000 of Tesla right before they announced profitability.  Thinking hey they miss slightly and I’ll come back in a lower price.  Missed it by that much.
2020-07-31T17:55:04.000Z,"Same here, people see the sticker price and faint! I was about €50 p/w on fuel, now down to €10(less most weeks) or €0!! if the sun is shinning on the solar panels. Add to that no service etc and it all adds up to better value in the long run."
2020-07-31T17:54:51.000Z,"You can do all sorts of mental gymnastics to come up with whatever price target you’re biased towards - $2k, $5k, I’ve heard $10k by 2025. But you have to ask yourself, does Tesla need to have an unreasonable market share (>15% of new car sales) to justify this price?"
2020-07-31T17:53:11.000Z,Price'll come down once they start making them at Giga Berlin though.
2020-07-31T17:49:37.000Z,"This will be the exact same as the Tesla Solar Shingle reveal

2020-07-31T17:06:08.000Z,"I think 8 for 1 would provide room for share price increase back to present levels and reflect expansion that will be taking place in next two years, provided all goes well with Tesla and the Global status."

2020-07-31T16:47:25.000Z,"I agree will be hesitation... If they can lock up agreement with Volkswagen, truly build an suv to price under Tesla, and make money from it. Then we have a competitor.

2020-07-31T02:22:16.000Z,Don’t get me wrong they look better than Tesla and I want more EV competition but I just feel like there are a lot of over promises with Fisker that seem like it will be hard for them to deliver at that price point and timeframe.
2020-07-31T02:08:18.000Z,Cheapest Tesla is about $35K - just *call* Tesla to order. Cheapest Tesla is about the same price as the average car.
2020-07-31T01:38:51.000Z,"While I think Fisker has a bright future, the model S was double the price so they both brought in similar dollar amounts. Ev’s weren’t nearly as popular in 2012. With that said If Fisker can get going, his car designs blow Tesla out of the water."

2020-07-30T03:53:03.000Z,Outside the USA Tesla’s are a lot more expensive. Needs to be ongoing work to reduce this price as gas cars are way cheaper. Until that price drops the arguement outside of USA is much more difficult to justify.

2020-07-27T22:57:20.000Z,Tesla sticker price seems expensive but after you factor in lower maintenance cost and resale value it works out to be similarly priced to a mid-priced sedan. Nott to mention the value and pleasure the M3 brings to your life!

2020-07-27T18:51:36.000Z,Please remember that Tesla will be extremely profitable as economies of scale and local suppliers lead to reduced costs. This is very bullish. Doesn't matter at all that they're giving away the profits with constant price cuts (definitely not because of competition).

2020-07-27T08:39:47.000Z,"If you bought a Tesla before yesterdays price reduction, you can have 100s of layers of tunnels, but only one layer on surface (to first approximation), therefore trains should be on surface, cars below."
2020-07-27T08:03:13.000Z,"Full Self Driving cars, is not something, Tesla will be the only one providing.
The market will react, direct to more companies, offering autonomous cars. I bet, price will not raise, when more will show up.
I also have no doubt that Tesla might have the market for 1-2 years!"
2020-07-27T07:51:13.000Z,He really tweeted it and then backpedaled by saying Tesla gets their lithium from Australia (as if introducing a new source of cheap lithium won't affect the price paid for AUS Li)
2020-07-27T07:34:51.000Z,"Not for that amount of money.

We deliberately did’t get a BMW i3 in 2015 because of price/range. Same here.

Now you can get a Tesla Model 3 for that price."
2020-07-27T07:20:13.000Z,"Even if they don't get the lithium from Bolivia, another source for them can mean that they can negotiate better.

In Australia they decide, that they will raise prices. Without another possible source, Tesla has to pay the raised price."

2020-07-27T06:17:28.000Z,"For those who regret not buying Tesla stock in the 300, will also regret not buying a Tesla with FSD at the current level, when the price will be double in the future."
2020-07-27T06:02:15.000Z,As long as there are more price insensitive buyers than sellers that is possible. But that does not change the fact that Tesla is a scam and TRASH company called car maker.
2020-07-27T05:54:53.000Z,"Every time, I travel I try to rent a Tesla, at a reasonable price. None of the rental companies carry them, only time I was successful was at Enterprise at Heathrow, where I got an S for around 100 gbp a day, with free unlimited Supercharging."

2020-07-27T05:43:40.000Z,Price of civilization. Haven't seen any freeways sponsored by Tesla or Toyota.
2020-07-27T05:42:49.000Z,Tesla increased price of Model 3 by $2k when they made basic autopilot standard. So in the end the price for FSD is about the same.
2020-07-27T05:40:45.000Z,I think the timing of the M3 rollout was perfect (probably unintentional) as it gave previous Tesla owners about 4 years to get over the abolishment of the tax subsidy. Price point kills all the  other ICE cars. Hardly see any new BMW 3 series on the road but see a LOT of M3’s.
2020-07-27T05:37:21.000Z,"In about 14 months time:

A Morgan Stanley analyst has placed price scenarios on Tesla $TSLA of

I don’t think there’s a hole lot polarizing about these as far as brands among consumers (except for Nike w supporting Kalpernick) except maybe price excess they represent. But that’s brand “value”."

2020-07-27T04:56:03.000Z,@vitaliyk Services like Tesla apps in the future. Insurance. How much does an insurance company worth? How much does Uber market cap is? Add this price to Tesla. Is like looking at apple business and just look at iPhones sales. What about services?
2020-07-27T04:53:21.000Z,"Dollar shithawked. Assets in value climb, gold value climb, dollar and all global papers down. What is up, this hot waitress pouring whiskey. Price is not fixated even if the number is the same. Stocks, tesla and gold ... fuck the dollar #es_f #spy"
2020-07-27T04:35:45.000Z,Tesla's price match guarantee is a joke. They can't do price match and they don't accept it.
2020-07-27T04:26:22.000Z,"#Tesla will deliver ~4 million vehicles in 2025 (grabbing ~7% of China’s total car market). Analyst Alexander Potter raised his price target to $2,322 (a further upside of >50% over the next 12 months)

2020-07-27T04:17:16.000Z,"I think people are going to be in for a very rude shock. If you look at the depreciation- if you take the total price of car + fsd as reference , in one yr tesla paid me only 68% of what i paid (32% loss for me). If you take only price of car without fsd - then 18% loss for me."
2020-07-27T04:08:41.000Z,"Didn’t you get the FSD money back when you sold the 3? The new owner should be happy to get FSD at the original price that you bought it for, considering it keeps going up."
2020-07-27T04:08:00.000Z,"Also, what’s missing here is that AP was originally $2K (EAP was $3K more on this which is where the $5K for EAP comes from). When Tesla included AP “for free” on all cars it actually increased the base price of all models by ~$1K or $1500. So someone buying FSD @ $8K really..."
2020-07-27T04:05:22.000Z,It’s accurate. Originally to upgrade from EAP to FSD it was $3K and they’ve increased FSD by $1K 2 times now...hence the $5K upgrade price.
2020-07-27T03:48:38.000Z,Further localization will bring down the price and #Tesla cars shall be cheaper and affordable. #China

$361 USD at low, 18Mar20 to high of $1643, 20Jul20. It has always been volatile, but never broke $500 before 2020.
It was over-valued before (based on production); current pricing is ridiculous."

2020-07-27T02:20:07.000Z,"It's not easy, but it must be done.
Tesla sales high end technology cars at a the price of luxurious cars. But if you compare with other brands (Audi, BMW) they not only have more details on the cars, but a much better customer service.
Tesla is going to the opposite direction"
2020-07-27T02:02:08.000Z,"yes, you won’t need to pay for FSD to generate income this way. however buying FSD in the car loan will be cheaper than paying Tesla Network full price every time"
2020-07-27T01:59:20.000Z,"It’s hard enough to get my head around a 10x multiple of share price in the next 10 years, let alone another 100x multiple from here. If the 100x happens I would likely convert quite a bit of it into RoboTaxi, MegaPack/Solar Utility and other Tesla businesses as well."
2020-07-27T01:58:17.000Z,"It's been 9 years since #gold was this high:

2020-07-27T01:32:16.000Z,"That’s revenue not deliveries. 

It includes the effect of Tesla cutting down their production of extremely popular and cheap model S and X.

2020-07-27T00:07:40.000Z,"Yeah, look what happened to Tesla. If we told you a year ago it would be at the current price, you would have considered us legally insane."
2020-07-26T23:38:57.000Z,I like the fact that they have multiple models on the way and at a relatively lower price. This should put them in direct competition with Tesla. Can you imagine getting in right now at $13 a share what are potential is!?!

Tesla is planning to undercut the price of gas powered vehicles, &  the maintenance on them are so much cheaper.  Fossil fuels are going away."
2020-07-26T21:03:30.000Z,People have been shorting Tesla stock since it's IPO. It's become a game akin to something straight out of a Silicon Valley plot. They make money every time Musk does something stupid and then they double down as soon as the price stabilizes. Many have gotten quite richer.
2020-07-26T20:53:01.000Z,The price is a mug?
2020-07-26T20:53:00.000Z,"You’re notably leaving out plugin hybrids, which already exist at cheaper price points to any Tesla vehicles, and are substantially more efficient to manufacture"
2020-07-26T20:28:26.000Z,Car & driver has article on it. Starts at $61k $5k more gets you some very minor upgrades. They compare it to the performance model 3 although all of its stats are less than the 3. Also the price has no upcoming FSD that Tesla has in the works. Character limited or would say more
2020-07-26T20:17:32.000Z,Tesla is pulling out of California. Can the Federal Government move the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to Arizona or Texas? Will IBM and others leave NYC. The N.Y.

2020-07-26T19:47:20.000Z,This is without energy. Effectively the share price should double today.

2020-07-26T19:38:26.000Z,Musk would say something about how he doesn't mind that other automobile manufactures are selling more EV models and more units a year than Tesla because that has always been Tesla's goals not to make Mush rich based on non-business related things like the stock price.
2020-07-26T19:09:40.000Z,"The price is getting to high for the average 3 owner. Some of us, is already doing the Tesla stretch."

2020-07-26T19:00:36.000Z,"Eberhard had been leading EV tech from the 1990s. He developed Tesla's first models (which were sports cars, the only EVs which could be sold, owing to the high price point), reportedly because he worried about US dependence on oil imports."
2020-07-26T19:00:36.000Z,"This is a great way to figure out what not to buy.

2020-07-26T18:32:15.000Z,"Most firms now offer fractional shares. This gives you the ability to buy fractions of shares rather than the full price of one.

Some are saying the price per ZEV credit has dropped a lot so not much impact, but as many OEMs don’t have 12-14% of their fleet made up by EVs, I would think demand would be high."

2020-07-26T17:07:52.000Z,They really can’t make them profitable so they cut corners on the interior which people obviously care about.  People are going to have a tough time justifying the price but for the first time they will actually consider an EV other than Tesla.  Sorry bolt you’re a compliance car
2020-07-26T16:22:34.000Z,"That's not what you were saying, you said stock price dictates success. Tesla can make hundreds of millions in annual loss and people still riding a hypetrain."

2020-07-26T16:11:16.000Z,"no, but they make them able to handle increased demand..

Tesla can create what demand is needed. By adding referals, free supercharging, lower price, build more superchargers, increase range.. etc. etc. 

They are in full control, because they have the best product out there."
2020-07-26T16:00:08.000Z,Your Tesla’s are not luxury enough to justify the price.
2020-07-26T15:48:11.000Z,"first I would suggest to test drive it yourself for a week, then talk to random tesla owners about how they like their tesla too...then you will KNOW the endgame here (I.E. what Tesla will become) and can work backwards from there to today’s share price"
2020-07-26T15:45:45.000Z,"We are seeing higher sales in US/China because in Europe Tesla’s are 10-40% more expensive vs US. Once Giga Berlin starts printing cars, legacy are f*****ed. There is no car that can compete with Tesla at the right price. In ‘22 a Leaf/Golf competitor will come from Tesla!"
2020-07-26T15:45:17.000Z,Because you can't tell me how much you think it should be worth. And if you can't tell me that then you don't know if the price is potentially way over stretched.
2020-07-26T15:27:37.000Z,"Legacy dealers can treat transaction prices on their own, depending on their situation. T can only lower prices large scale, as soon as there is lack of order intake. Obviously, lacking responsiveness to price sensitivity that way. Price erosion is a problem."

Tesla has no margins. Not sure how you think they do.

2020-07-19T02:59:40.000Z,Or could sell the car with the price of the battery discounted from it. Tesla keeps the battery for energy generation and storage in the virtual power plant? <30k$ car could be possible then.

Any growth will result in price drops. Which increases sales. Which ramps up EV adoption. Which serves the mission.

The only reason for margin growth is demand > supply and Tesla trying to limit demand."

The real question is how high will the capacity utilization get and how many price cuts."
2020-07-18T23:10:58.000Z,"Well as long as we agree about Tesla's lack of growth, just ok margins & y/y existing mkt declines, we can make predictions going forward accounting for price cuts and mix deterioration.

2020-07-18T21:30:30.000Z,"I really like my M3 but Tesla have REALLY got to sort out their quality control.  I think a lot of people will be attracted to Polestar 2 - similar price, range and performance to M3LR.  But will be in another league when it comes to build quality and customer service."
2020-07-18T21:25:27.000Z,I guess this was more eye opening to me to see what others pay. I wasn’t trying to boast or anything. I’m assuming after I move out of an apartment the price will change dramatically
2020-07-18T21:17:07.000Z,Tesla's retain their value surprisingly well relative to ICE cars. Some guy on here just sold his 3 yr old Model 3 with 50k on the clock for 97% its original price.

2020-07-14T23:03:09.000Z,How much lower? Why not reassess possible demand closer to the time Tesla originally envisaged than discounting it out of hand - & possibly @ a lower price point to allow families easier access EV entry point?
2020-07-14T23:01:39.000Z,The main reason for the higher price is manufacturing cost. Older OEMs have spent far less time developing their EV manufacturing lines. Still at low volume . 3rd party supliers drives up the price furthering. No one can currently produce and EV for profit except Tesla.

2020-07-13T16:48:42.000Z,I'm all pro Tesla. But the only way i see this price validated is by the successful roll out of FSD.
2020-07-13T16:48:05.000Z,I think the current environmental footprint of Tesla is already well known. Could Tesla’s elevated stock price reflect more of an assessment of where things will be 2025? Stock prices are often wrong but always worth examining the why

2020-07-13T16:40:41.000Z,Likely triggered by Tesla’s price action? Seems like its stock will reach top quite soon
2020-07-13T16:39:59.000Z,Also - most people tend to forget that Tesla is not fundamentally a car manufacturer. They are a battery company. Auto sales should not wholly indicate the company’s value... Much more long term value in other future uses. Hard to price that.

2020-07-13T13:49:31.000Z,"Why do you think the drop in price was due to slumping sales? Tesla has been dropping prices regularly as their efficiency increases. This quarter they sold more than they produced, because they couldn't sell a lot of cars because they couldn't deliver due to lockdowns."
2020-07-13T13:49:23.000Z,Congratulations on the stock price.  Be the visionary we all hope you are.
2020-07-13T13:49:13.000Z,I don't understand this price cut Tesla had on the Model Y. Some people saying it is because of weakening demand. Some saying they are just taking advantage of economy of scales but if they still had the demand for it why not keep that extra margin when you need that cash flow?

So ~ 20% of that will be $39. So 2.6x $Nio Friday's close. Plus less uncertainty. $tsla #nio #Tesla #EVs

2020-07-11T22:27:58.000Z,"This is no surprise for me. I think the model Y pricing was too close to the Model S. And the S is more premium and has almost same functionality. 
This is a good move from Tesla. Sorry for existing model Y owners but you are not the first Tesla price reduction collateral damages"
2020-07-11T22:26:55.000Z,"Funny, if Tesla’s are appreciating assets, why don’t they pay you to lease the vehicles?  I mean the residual would be higher than the sales price.  Seems we should be compensated for storing these investment vehicles."
2020-07-11T22:24:49.000Z,"Tesla drops Model Y price by $3,000 - incentive enough??"
2020-07-11T22:24:47.000Z,It’s going the way of the Yugo. Cut price until money is lost on every unit. What would they care? Zach’s magic black hat can hide that too. “Tesla. Now the Disposable Car!” Pick up spare parts in the middle of any street.
2020-07-11T22:23:51.000Z,"http://tesla.com still show 2 month wait time for a model Y delivery in California.
Lower price, but 2 month wait time... puzzling.
On top of this, Tesla still got backlog MY orders to fill from 2019."
2020-07-11T22:23:00.000Z,"If you're talking about price there's nothing special about a tesla. You can say the same thing about basically any other car. You're not ""the privileged few"" or brand ambassadors, you just chose a product that other's didn't. Regardless, Teslas are the future of the industry."

2020-07-11T22:21:46.000Z,@elonmusk Glad to hear that Tesla Y price reduced by 3k! But what about those who just picked up theirs 10 days ago?
2020-07-11T22:21:04.000Z,"You said you don’t get how much you save. We have established you save nothing and pay much more from the get go. Also Tesla’s still aren’t that reliable, in warranty I bet it has more issues than a German car. Again, fuel is fine - 10 years of fuel Worth on the added price."
2020-07-11T22:20:30.000Z,If Tesla can start producing a vehicle in the same price range of Toyota corollas its over for everyone.

2020-07-11T22:15:48.000Z,"If Tesla’s electric vehicles reach price parity with Toyota’s and Honda’s it is like giving a Porsche like performance to everyone. Yes, Porsche will die. Atleast it’s ICE tech division. It will die."

2020-07-11T21:52:36.000Z,"In March 2019, Tesla unveiled the Model Y. The event was an epic disaster. There was very little social media buzz about the Model Y and the product was widely panned as basically a clone of the Model 3 at a higher price."

2020-07-11T21:34:20.000Z,"I'll be honest - its a decent car and has OTA updates but not selling in big numbers and a lack of potential V2G, FSD and no supercharger network means it will be left behind.

Oh and its starting price is £65,000 - £10,000 more than the Tesla Model Y and £22,000 more than the 3"
2020-07-11T21:33:41.000Z,"@Tesla MO. Find the cream of cultist or gullible to buy the lemons as the highest price and then drop the price to go after the next tranche.
Keep dropping the price until demand is where it needs to be. No money can be made at that price so raise capital. Rinse/Repeat.

2020-07-10T23:17:43.000Z,I reckon i have lost maybe 4000 bucks trying to short Tesla. I cut when i see very strong price action.  I just don't agree with the bull case. But it wouldn't be the first thing i was wrong about. And won't be the last.

2020-07-10T22:54:28.000Z,Those that sold Tesla early and now are too scared to buy in again at current price can becomes resentful and end up as skeptics. This shows you how our own self interests greatly shifts our perception of reality.

2020-07-10T22:51:34.000Z,I like Tesla as a brand name and its position in EV's and use of Autonomous Driving software is definitely unassailable. But recently one has to take into consideration that it's share price is overvalued and there are some reports of shady accounting policies.
