2019-05-09T20:01:17.000Z,"And the world cannot address its energy habits without directly reducing emissions in the transportation and power sectors. 

This issue is Tesla’s entire reason for existing."
2019-05-09T19:50:26.000Z,"Annual CO2 emissions have approximately doubled over the past 50 years to over 35 gigatons per year. The path that the world currently is on is unsustainable and unwise. 

The world cannot reduce CO2 emissions without addressing energy generation and consumption."
