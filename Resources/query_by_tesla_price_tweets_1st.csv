I’d take a bolt over a loaded Corolla, but after price cuts it’s cheaper than a base one."
2020-10-07T17:22:07.000Z,Something to consider is that with the extreme drop in price per KWh that Tesla is undertaking it will be possible to design cars that look as nice as the Polestar and still get over 400 miles of range. Bottom line is that  cars will not have to be as efficient.

2020-10-07T16:50:37.000Z,Tesla trades at 40x the P/S of many OEMs so its not enough to be a little better. A little better might mean 4x the P/S or a 90% drop in price then comparing might make some sense.

2020-10-04T02:46:15.000Z,Gonna blow up when they start selling more than 25k a quarter which is coming pretty soon. Good thing about $nio stock is that the price of it is justified. Tesla imo is way too overvalued. Nio got a big room to grow.
2020-10-04T02:46:09.000Z,"Do it by market.

You will see sales fade the second year even with multiple price cuts. Any objective analysis would predict growth will slow dramatically once there aren't any major new markets. Next year there aren't major new markets. Tesla is producing sustainable growth."
2020-10-04T02:39:39.000Z,"Being limited by demand alone is Teslas goal.
At that point, Tesla would expand market by reducing price.

2020-09-27T17:37:00.000Z,Theta is the influence of time on theoption.  It increases as the option gets closer to expiration.  The 92.72% indicates a very high level of correlation to Tesla’s stock price - for ever $1 change in TSLA the option should change by $0.93.
2020-09-27T17:34:55.000Z,I thought about that on the Tesla option contract I owned last week when you tweeted after hours and the stock price proceeded to tank from 450 to sub 370.

2020-09-27T17:25:16.000Z,The $35k car was off book. And still may be. You need to call Tesla to order it.  TSLAs mission is to further a sustainable future. They reduce price as they improve cost of manufacturing like every other company. They maintain their gross profits at 20-25%. Please go research it
2020-09-27T17:15:22.000Z,"Permission for a small debate?
IMHO, #Tesla's stock price stumbled right after #BatteryDay simply because a $25,000 car may mean fewer margins for the company. I think it can be a sign of a short-sighted vision, but traders' mind often is.

2020-09-27T17:08:42.000Z,What inputs got you to a P/S of 11? That’s almost double of even Tesla for 2024 based on future sales. Share price should be the last value that populates from your formulas.

2020-09-27T02:22:56.000Z,@Tesla so with this new battery technology what does it mean for the wall? Will it change? Will there be a decrease in price?
2020-09-27T02:20:59.000Z,Yes @Tesla I am waiting for the day when the price of an electric car drops a little bit
2020-09-27T01:56:26.000Z,Seeing if I could get more visibility. FSD is $8k compared to $4k for EAP... it was worth spending a little to see if Musk might see it & allow the discounted price to be added to orders that haven’t been delivered yet...

2) Price volatility."
2020-09-27T00:50:47.000Z,don’t you think that Tesla will choose something between the two extremes. Enough range to beat all other German cars and enough little to not fuck up Americans and to be able to lower the price a bit more with the same margin
2020-09-27T00:42:50.000Z,"@elonmusk I saw that you’re developing a new Tesla that’s 25,000 dollars. Usually hatchbacks go for that price, so is it a hatchback? Also could I get one if for free if I guess correctly?"

I'm also wary of Elon Musk being a volatile personality.

2020-09-22T11:23:27.000Z,"Where you are making a mistake is assuming tesla is just a car company... These chaps are also big time into software, batteries and solar. One of their major shareholders was on CNBC the other day talking of the price hitting $1000 by end of Q1 2021."
2020-09-22T11:07:41.000Z,"Then you need to make e-cars way cheaper or at least a uniform price around the world... Tesla's are min. $10k more expensive in Canada vs US, accounting for exchange rate.  That's a lot for shipping."

2020-09-22T10:29:23.000Z,"~$100/kWh is the point of manufacturing cost parity between ICE and EV cars. Tesla have got extremely coy about these numbers themselves in recent years, but our (v well informed) man here predicting they are essentially breaking into CHEAPER ""sticker price"" territory imminently."
2020-09-22T10:29:22.000Z,Investor confidence mwana. Tesla is 10 years ahead of it's closed competitor in the EV game. They've even had to make it the stock cheaper by splitting it and making it cheaper so that people can still join the party. Expect the price to double once the Chinese factory is online.

2020-09-22T08:24:44.000Z,Agree that there is a lot of hype but not sure you can vaguely compare the two. The Porsche Taycan is £84K . The Tesla Model 3 has similar (if not better performance) and is half the price. Not sure when it became the norm for average car prices to be £30K+ :-|
2020-09-22T08:03:02.000Z,"Tesla is definitely not vapourware. Teslas are selling like hotcakes (for now). They're very good cars. Company has $10B in the bank with factories to come.

2020-09-22T06:29:38.000Z,Elon is warning of a disappointing battery day & difficulties scaling production. The latter point being my concern for a while and reason for my bearish view on Tesla stock. A great company with a bright future but the stock price could fall hard as it is so far overvalued.
2020-09-22T06:26:57.000Z,"This has been the basis of my bearish view on Tesla stock. The company is valued at over $400bn but to justify that price tag production needs to scale at an impossible rate. Great tech, great cars and a bright future but a stock price that is so overvalued."

2020-09-20T20:48:14.000Z,Tesla did hit 420. I can’t believe I didn’t see the pattern forming earlier and get the price action for the 420 9/11 calls. I thought it was jokes.
2020-09-20T20:45:18.000Z,absolutely I agree the probability of success is very very low that they have game changing battery tech. But that's what the hype train is about and the recent increase in share price.  Very expensive bets...
2020-09-20T20:37:17.000Z,"Speaking as a rational Tesla shareholder, Elon’s compensation package is a win/win.

The only “expense” Tesla has to declare is imaginary, the “max payout” involves Elon paying $7.1B cash to buy more stock at the price people paid the day he signed & he can’t sell it for 5 years."
2020-09-20T20:35:27.000Z,"Honestly I don't quite understand the need for posturing. At their price point, I can't figure out if they really want to be a high volume manufacturer or niche. Remember in hyper performance niche we've already got @AutomobiliRimac. Tesla in mainstream."
2020-09-20T20:34:08.000Z,They should produce a car first and knowing Lucid this will probably be twice the price. I think 9.9 seconds more than fast enough. Produce cars first then comeback and fight Tesla. And Plaid Model S performance will probably be software limited.

2020-09-20T18:16:22.000Z,I think demand will grow as people come to the realization how much value Tesla vehicles have vs cost. This will translate into more sales and each subsequent quarter analysts will revise outlook. These est price targets of $600 will look cheap.
2020-09-20T18:06:52.000Z,Model 3 starts at $35k US which is less than average new vehicle price in the US. Tesla is the only company that’s driving down the cost of EVs quickly.

2020-09-14T21:28:42.000Z,"Free supercharging was an incentive, my model 3 came with 2 yrs of free Superchsrging.

2020-09-14T20:14:42.000Z,"That's not what this survey says at all.    If that's true, electrical cars wouldn't be popular at all and Tesla wouldn't have a skyrocketing stock price."

In my opinion Tesla stock price is really expensive"
2020-09-14T20:07:18.000Z,Worth picking up a strong number 2 stock that you can sell if Tesla gets down to an attractive price again (I have 95% Tesla 5% Apple)
2020-09-14T20:06:01.000Z,Just be careful man...look at the options call volume. It can be like what SoftBank did I’m August where they inflated the price a bit. It’s just crazy because these 5/10/15% swings either way are unhealthy lol. Sold all my tesla a little bit ago at around 470 so I’m good lol
2020-09-14T20:03:27.000Z,"it's like how Trump's value changes depending on how he feels when he gets up. same with Tesla. if the vibes are good, the investors are vibing, and the stock price shoots up. we live in a vibe based economy where everything depends on how good the vibes are."

2020-09-14T19:57:29.000Z,I don’t think Tesla’s stock price is a good indicator of progress (or predicted future progress) on climate change broadly

2020-09-14T19:24:40.000Z,"Rivian won't have level 3 for at least a year or two. Tesla is way ahead on autonomous. Price/range/acceleration look better on paper for the 3-motor CT, but dubious, and 4-motor, interior, packaging, likely much higher build quality/service beat the CT for me regardless."
2020-09-14T19:23:33.000Z,"1) According to Troy's Model 3 tracker, take-rate for Tesla's vaporware ""Full self-driving"" option for configurations made in July 2020 (After price hike to $8k on July, 1st) was 16%. The take rate for all configurations made in August and September (MTD) is 12%.

2020-09-14T19:10:30.000Z,"Your main interest, okay. I'm not telling you not to buy a Tesla. If you like the car, fine. I'm pointing out that Elon is lying about FSD to defraud other consumers who do care & to manipulate the stock price higher. I'm using one of the greatest minds in tech to prove my point."
2020-09-14T19:09:20.000Z,"I do believe there are reasons not to buy one.

But over-hyped, wouldn't see that as an issue
And over-priced, show me an EV with Tesla's range and same/lower price.

But yeah gas is quicker on road trips, but who's driving for hours without stopping, and petrol smells nice."
2020-09-14T18:59:22.000Z,I have another. Stock price. I had a friend who was cautioned by others to not buy a Tesla last year out of concern for the company going under. (he listened to me and loves it). Now that SP has gone up: 1. more people talk about TSLA which is free advertising.

An extra 40K unit year over year with seven price cuts is nothing..  Toyota does 2,600,000 cars per quarter. It's literally a rounding error."

2020-09-14T17:46:18.000Z,Time will tell. I think putting products on a. Board and manufacturing them is two different things. As it’s been proven first mover advantage does not typically translate into a winner take all. Share price reflects a winner take all. Watch out.
2020-09-14T17:46:11.000Z,"Are the Chinese Tesla's really cheaper than US ones?  
291,800 yuan is the SR+ price with VAT and before subsidy.  291,800 / 1.13 (VAT) x 0.15 (exchange rate) = $38,734 to Tesla. US version is $37,900.  So the EU will pay extra for MIC and unit volumes will increase??"

2020-09-14T17:30:58.000Z,"Sure it does. He's watching the price action by the minute (or 30 sec, or even 15 seconds). He sees technical points on the chart where it's holding ground. He buys (on margin) a boatload, hoping to scalp a +$5 move. Profit. If it drops, he hits sell and takes a loss."
2020-09-14T17:21:06.000Z,Don’t be reluctant to buy even one share of the higher price stocks like Tesla or others over $200 as they can be the one best performer in your portolio. As stated above follow the rules of the game and never go all in in just 1 stock. Good fortune to you.
2020-09-14T17:20:34.000Z,Selling and buying at the same price 25min apart makes no sense. If is was even $1 lower in repurchase I would say ok.

2020-09-14T17:04:14.000Z,That’s what I am saying. Their stock price doesn’t represent quality in product. Reason it does so well is the convenience of ordering and cheap price. Definitely not popular because of the taste. I had better pizzas from grocery stores.

2020-09-12T20:44:02.000Z,The sun shines and the wind blows everywhere on earth. Fun fact: Solar & wind coupled with batteries is already the cheapest energy source worldwide. Price of renewables continues to go down. What happens to Alberta when the price of oil goes down?
2020-09-12T20:41:31.000Z,Lesson in economics Hillbilly: Gasoline is at least 40% of the total O&G market worldwide. Oil prices are strongly affected by fluctuations as little as 5%. What happens to price as supply is greater than demand?
2020-09-12T20:35:13.000Z,stock price comparisons are irrelevant to who brings more to the world....
2020-09-12T20:33:27.000Z,it’s actually very smart by tesla. introduce the split put PR behind it to get silly retailers into buying the stock because they think it’s “cheap” dump the price action force the new shareholders to sell at a loss and long positions or insiders buy back shares at a sale finesse
2020-09-12T20:17:40.000Z,"That would give the advantage to me. If Elon Musk succeeds in putting a human on Mars, this would have a very positive effect on the price of Tesla shares, so I would win way more than 20k."
2020-09-12T20:16:06.000Z,Elon been tweaking the price of Tesla. Crashes it on purpose. He beat the SEC and made 50 million off they ass earlier this year lol
2020-09-12T20:14:44.000Z,"2 - Elon didn't pay himself that. That growth was the result of Tesla's stock price increasing as people purchased shares on the market. Tesla's employees also all get shares, so their net worth grew as well."
2020-09-12T19:53:49.000Z,"For example Tesla's stocks skyrocketed recently (314€), however a year ago it was at 50€. That price is in the range for normal people to buy, hence you don't have to be rich."
2020-09-12T19:53:00.000Z,I would think if this were happening already there would have been a chance on the Australian order page in terms of price
2020-09-12T19:40:12.000Z,"I mean sure. But they would not need to cut the price. Just add moee value to the car. Perhaps by a few thousand. But not 19,000 as you stated earlier. That would maybe fit for a tesla compact car."
2020-09-12T19:38:16.000Z,"But how does the arrangement between Tesla, Octopus, and the consumer work? Do Tesla and Octopus share in the price arbitrage?"
2020-09-12T19:34:53.000Z,Fellow husky here!  Doesn’t seem like Tesla’s going anywhere but I’d buy three shares of Apple for the same price instead :)
2020-09-12T19:25:08.000Z,Funny to think how much Tesla's stock price dropped just cuz he hit some weed on joe rogans show and now people can't get enough of it
2020-09-12T19:23:34.000Z,"Nope. No price cuts, just bigger margins for tesla and more range on the car"

2020-09-12T19:01:01.000Z,I don’t think you realise tesla has a market cap@of +/- $350bn. Which amount to the totality of all top automakers combined. So much is priced in that beta versions of anything will make the area price fall not rise.
2020-09-12T19:00:40.000Z,"So much to look forward on  day: building (?)speed vs nearest competitor, energy (?) vs nearest competitor, technical hard stuff explained to ""normal media"", Lucid air vs tacan s vs tesla in speed, quarters mile, nűmbergring and range vs price, and CYBERSEXYR2SEMI spaceX :-D ??"
2020-09-12T18:57:41.000Z,"The world is modular.  Car price base, then you choose the type of battery you want.  Tesla needs to get into V2G if they intend to really be into sustainability."

2020-09-12T18:13:22.000Z,"I agree that @IONITY_EU may have pushed the price too high as it’s probably 25% higher than petrol per mile. 

I suppose for @Tesla owners, Superchargers where available are much better value at <½ cost of petrol. But they aren’t available to non-Tesla cars whereas Ionity is."

2020-09-12T18:08:14.000Z,"They should just let all the others pay a premium, maybe 20% more than Tesla owners and then lower the price for Tesla owners accordingly- win for EV’s and Tesla owners both."

2020-09-12T17:47:22.000Z,"In Europe all car manufacturers have requirements to offer substantial electric options, and the offers are good. Tesla's numerous flaws force them to compete on price alone."

2020-09-12T17:33:58.000Z,"I'm as anti $tsla as the $tslaq crazies and the stock price shouldn't be anywhere near where it is. Tesla is a car company and should be valued as such.  

 My dads retirement would be much better if $F traded even remotely where $tsla valuation was years back."

2020-09-12T17:28:25.000Z,"Lucid Air is 115miles ahead of Tesla rn.  I think, it is worth the price. If someone can afford to spend $100k on a car, can as well buy $170k with better specs."
2020-09-12T17:24:00.000Z,It’s essentially impossible to talk about the future of the automotive industry without bringing up Tesla. I don’t think most people seem to understand what this means. To me it means there is a tipping point coming. Soon buying an EV will be the only logical choice.Price parity.

2020-09-12T17:16:07.000Z,"I don’t have to choose sides in this debate, because one I don’t own a Tesla, and if I did I would be brutally honest about the product because that’s how products improve. Two I don’t own stock in anything and don’t care about the price or the market in general. I hope it burns."
2020-09-12T17:06:19.000Z,Its called volume and it's necessary for companies to be successful. That's why it matters. It's the reason Tesla now has a $38K car because they could have never hit volume to be successful without that lower price point.
2020-09-12T17:05:42.000Z,Wish it was affordable to the middle class and by that I mean who can afford mortgage and one car payment not two at the same price to finance
2020-09-12T16:28:24.000Z,"No, not with the lead in production tesla has.  they will become a good competitor though once their production gets up to speed.  It took tesla years to get to this point, and their cars are still in the high end of the price bracket.  Given some time, and they will do well :)"
2020-09-12T16:24:54.000Z,"If for free for non Tesla owners this would be unfair for Tesla owners who have to pay, it could also cause huge congestion at popular chargers and of course they can’t give it away for free - my X is from 2016 so it has free charging for life but that was built into price of car"
2020-09-12T16:23:38.000Z,"I love Tesla but let's not forget the price is at $1,860 pre split. Keep that in mind when looking at the $372 price people. Will buy more soon but there is inherent risk at this price."
2020-09-12T16:20:18.000Z,@elonmusk sir price too matters for all. By the way I'm a dreamer of urs
2020-09-12T16:17:29.000Z,"It’s a superior car at a higher price. I don’t think it will steal very many customers from Tesla. Just from ICE and the Taycan.

I almost bought a Model S in 2015 because it was the only good EV available at any price. I wanted something less expensive but nothing existed… 1/"
2020-09-12T16:16:53.000Z,Hey “genius”: what happens to O&G price when the largest market (fuel = half of total) is replaced by EVs. You think prices are low now? 
2020-09-12T16:14:18.000Z,"Does your obsession for oil come from sniffing too much of it? I understand your math skills are limited, but the bottom line is that O&G is replaced quicker than you can imagine. O&G price follows demand."

2020-09-12T15:44:06.000Z,hey Reich so tesla is a ESOP means Musk owns 51% and the workers own 49%. SO taking 10%  from their pay and putting it in stock means this:  Musk made 5.1%  in stock  price increase and the workers made a stock increase of 4.9% means they took a 5.1% lost in pay.
2020-09-12T15:42:55.000Z,I always through Tesla had the watermelon farm in their sights. I can image Elon turning up with a bag of cash. They must sell the water mellons for a premium price. 600k an acre!

2020-09-12T14:24:43.000Z,I was in the same camp for a long time until I realized that things move extremely fast in US once economic value and product superiority of a new technology is proven. Case in point: utility battery storage installation and Tesla adoption despite high price point....

2020-09-12T13:44:17.000Z,I don't know anything about that project. But i can check the chart. It rallies like Tesla. Price target is possibly 1.66 usd according to preditive fibonacci.
2020-09-12T13:41:28.000Z,@elonmusk maybe non-tesla owners can buy charge credits with the Tesla-app and then unlock the Supercharger from within the app. Price has to be different from Tesla owners and dependent on charge speed/time the stall is occupied
2020-09-12T13:21:07.000Z,I think that you should contrast the offering from @IONITY_EU with that of @Tesla. I would be extremely happy if Tesla were to open up CCS Charging to all users on a purely transactional basis charging €.79 and charging Tesla users whatever price they wanted to.
